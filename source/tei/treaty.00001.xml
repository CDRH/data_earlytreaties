Brethren<lb/>


Our last meeting ended with so happy an Agreement &amp; such firm
assurances and hearty resolutions on both sides,  that  if  they  are
faithfully <orig reg="observed">observ<hi rend="super">d</hi> </orig> we shall  always  meet  with joyful countenances<lb/><lb/> 
</p>

<p>
You then promised me solemnly not to have any correspondence with the
French, but to depend entirely on the English &amp; cleave  close  to
them<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
That you would keep the Path open for the Farr  Indians  to  come  to
trade with this Province<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
That you would never molest Virginia  nor  any  other  of  the  Kings
Provinces for the future &amp; that you allowed it  was  in  vain  to
promise any thing unless you resolve to perform [it]<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
I begin therefore by demanding of you a  solemn  assurance  that  you
will continue firm to what you then engaged, that you will inform  me
truly of your principal late Transactions &amp;

<pb n="658"/>

designs &amp; advice with me upon them so that  I  may  be  convinced
that you have an entire confidence  in  me  &amp;  observe  an  exact
Sincerity in  your  whole  Conduct  towards  me  which  will  be  the
strongest Tyes of a lasting Friendship between us — Give  a  Belt of Wampum<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
I must now particularly thank the Brethren, for their refusing to  go
out a fighting in Company with some French Indians, who invited  them
lately to it, this a very promising token of your  good  disposition,
&amp; makes me hope that you will satisfie me that  the  preparations
you are making for going out to War are not contrary to your  Promise
made last year, give a Belt of Wampum<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Because the renewing the Covenant Chain with you in the  name  of  my
great &amp;  good  Master  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  King  of  Great Britain &amp; your loving Father in the  behalf  of  all  His  <abbr expan="Matys">Mat<hi rend="super">ys</hi></abbr> Provinces in North America, is the  most  solemn Act which we have together, I think it proper that it  may  be  first
diligently searched that there may be no spots or  stains  left  upon
it<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
For that Purpose I have first desired the Brethren to let me know how
clean it has been kept with regard to this Province, and to the  same
end the Governors of Virginia &amp; Pensilvania are  come  hither  at
the desire of the Brethren and with the advice and  consent  of  this
Government to treat of some matters on the behalf of their  Provinces
that may remove all spotts that may remain on the Covenant Chain with
Relation to them &amp; as they are one nation and under the same King
with us I doubt not but  the  Brethren  will  hear  them  with  great
attention and answer them with that regard which is their  due  &amp;
when these particular Points are firmly settled, the General Covenant
Chain will then be made so clean &amp; bright that I  shall  then  be
able to renew it with the greatest Satisfaction &amp; with  a  Strong
confidence that it will shine with new Lustre  as  long  as  the  sun
&amp; moon shall endure<lb/><lb/>

Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You made Propositions to us some days ago, which we are now  some  to
answer, but since divers of our Sachims are not yet arrived, we shall
not be able to answer so well as if those

<pb n="659"/>

wise men were present with us and that we had consulted with them  so
that we hope your <orig reg="Excellency">Excell<hi rend="super">cy</hi></orig> will excuse us if we
answer not so fully &amp; distinctly as otherwise we would if we  had
their assistance<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You told us that we in our last  conference  about  a  year  ago  had
renewed the Covenant Chain &amp; was desirous to know  how  the  same
has been kept by us in respect to this  Province,  it  is  so  lately
since that was done that the Sun is scarcely gone down since so  that
the Renovation is fresh in our Memory &amp; we can assure you that we
have kept the Covenant Chain inviolable on our Parts according to our
Promise &amp; engage to continue to do the same  faithfully<lb/><lb/>

It is now a year ago since you forbid us to have  any  correspondence
with the French but to cleave to the English and we did then  promise
to obey your commands in that matter as we have actually  done  &amp;
do further promise solemnly that [henceforth] we will not  correspond
with the French of Canada but adhere &amp;  cleave  strongly  to  the
English<lb/><lb/>

You told us the same time that we should give a free Passage  to  the
Far Indians to come to this Place to Trade which we have  done  &amp;
give them all the encouragement &amp; assistance  that  lays  in  our
Power, &amp; not only so but sent Agents to  those  Far  Indians  who
trade with the French to invite them to come here to Albany, but  our
Agents are not yet returned &amp; as soon as  they  come  back  shall
give your Excellency an account of their answer<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

We  have  told  you  that   we   have   not   only   permitted   <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi> </orig> Farr Indians to come through our Country to trade
in this Town but  sent  our  agents  thither  to  invite  them  &amp;
required them to tell the Far Indians that  they  should  have  goods
very cheap. We therefore desire that the Traders may  be  ordered  to
let the Far Indians have good Penny worths, rather cheaper than we of
the 5 Nations have it ourselves, which will be the only means to draw
them and to induce them to come hither<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You did last year likewise charge  &amp;  command  us  not  to  go  a
fighting towards Virginia, not  to  pass  over  the  great  River  of
Patawmack, nor the Ridge of High Mountains that surround Virginia  we
have observed your commands to the best  of  our  knowledge  in  that
Particular Some of our People have been out  a  Warring  against  the
Flatheads which of old have been our enemies, but they  live  to  the
Westward &amp; Southward of Virginia &amp; have not passed the  Ridge
of the Mountains nor the said River, we remember  you  also  told  us
then, that it was in vain to make any  promise,  except  we  resolved
firmly to keep it, which we  have  punctually  done  in  this  affair
hitherto<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You likewise told us that if any matter of moment happened among  us,
that we should acquaint you therewith  and  take  your  advice  which
would be a sure token to show that we put our Trust &amp;  confidence
in you which would be the strongest  Tyes  of  a  lasting  Friendship
between us, which we will do sincerely &amp; truly  &amp;  repeat  to
your <orig reg="Excellency">Excell<hi rend="super">cy</hi></orig> again that we will communicate to
you all the Principal late Transactions &amp; matters of  consequence
that we are privy to both good &amp; bad &amp; thereupon gave a  Belt
of Wampum<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="660"/>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

We take notice that you thanked us  for  not  suffering  any  of  our
Indians to go a Warring with the French Indians of Canada, we resolve
to do the same for the future &amp; disuade any of our People to join
with the French Indians to go to War, &amp;  if  any  of  the  French
Indians should happen to come through our Country to go a warring  we
will endeavor to stop them, <sic corr="but">bnt</sic> if they  cannot  be  persuaded
then we will warn them not to go over the Great  Ridge  of  Mountains
that surround Virginia, nor to  pass  over  the  Great  River  called
Potowmack<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You say that you are informed that there was  a  warlike  Preparation
making among the Five Nations which we acknowledge to be true but  we
know not as yet ourselves where they intend to go. Two years ago  Two
Tuskarores brought a Belt of Wampum from the Governor of Virginia (as
they said) and thereby in  the  name  of  the  Governor  of  Virginia
desired  the  five  Nations   to   make   War   &amp;   destroy   the
Tadirighrones,<ref n="1" target="n660.01"/> but  being  informed  that  the
Governor of Virginia was to be at Albany we deferred  any  resolution
about that affair, till we had spoken with him ourselves<lb/><lb/>

Here they stopped, being late and growing dark desired that they  may
make their further answer on  Munday  which  was  agreed  to  but  it
happened to rain all Munday so that they did not meet  together  till
Tuesday the <orig reg="4th">4<hi rend="super">th</hi> </orig> of  September  1722,  when  the
Sachims of the Five Nations proceeded  to  make  their  answer  &amp;
said<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You have told us since our last conference on Saturday that  you  was
informed some of our Sachims had been at Canada  &amp;  treated  with
the Governor there, true it  is  that  some  of  those  Sachims  <orig reg="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> are now dayly expected  with  the  Blawbek  Cheif
Sachim of <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Sinnekees have been there &amp; we
will discover to you the contents of their conference which they  had
with the Governor of Canada as soon as they arrive<lb/><lb/>

We inform you also that 3 companies of our People  are  gone  out  to
fight against the Flatheads that have been our enemies of a long time
there are also two French Indians that live at Cadarachqui that  went
out a fighting 2 years ago towards Virginia by the  way  of  Cayouge,
&amp; have their abode among the Tuskarores that live  near  Virginia
&amp; go backwards and Forwards<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

We  will  now  tell  you  the  Resolution  &amp;  Opinion   of   <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> 5 Nations that although diverse  have  endeavored
to raise jealousies &amp; evil Reports among us, &amp; so perswade us
to have a bad opinion of our Brethren the English yet we never  would
give ear nor hearken to them but have had from the  first  making  of
the Covenant Chain a firm Resolution  to  keep  the  same  inviolable
&amp; we are resolved to persist in that Resolution  always<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You have sent for us Sachims of the five nations to come  here  &amp;
told us that the Governors of Virginia &amp; Pensilvania would be  at
Albany for which Message we are thankful &amp; in  your  Propositions
you acquaint us that they are come to treat  of  matters  of  Publick
concern relating

<note id="n660.01" n="1">Called by the English, sometimes Catawbas, <hi rend="italics">ante</hi>,     491;     sometimes     Saponies,     <hi rend="italics">post</hi>, p. 673; also <hi rend="italics">Pennsylvania

<pb n="661"/>

to Peace and Concord, we are come for the same purpose and  have  the
same Intentions and put away all evil things and embrace  that  which
is good &amp; amicable did give Belt of Wampum<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

We desire you not to be impatient because of the long stay of some of
the Principal of the Sachims of the five  Nations,  which  we  hourly
expect, but to be easy they are your bosom friend &amp; we would fain
have them here present before we give our final  answer  because  the
matters are of importance &amp; we would gladly have their advice and
Council do give 3 Skins<lb/><lb/>

As we have earnestly desired your <orig reg="Excellency">Excell<hi rend="super">cy</hi></orig>  to
have a  little  Patience  so  we  beg  the  Honorable  <abbr expan="Coll:">Coll: </abbr>  <abbr expan="Alex.">Alex.</abbr>
Spotswood, Governor of Virginia and  the  <abbr expan="Honorable">Hônble</abbr>  <abbr expan="Sr"> S<hi rend="super">r </hi></abbr> William Keith Bart Governor of  Pensilvania  that they would be pleased to be easy &amp; patient likewise,  till  these Cheif Sachims arrive being well assured that they will  be  extreamly
glad to see you &amp; the said two Governors. Gave 3 Skins to each of
the Governors of Virginia &amp; Pensilvania <lb/><lb/>

His Excellency told them he had staid a  long  time  for  them  &amp;
desired to know if they had any advice  whereabouts  they  were,  who
answered that they had certain advice that five days ago the Blawbeck
&amp; his Company arrived at Oneyde<lb/><lb/>

His Excellency ordered them to send an express immediately for  them,
since his affairs required him to be at New York &amp; could not stay
above 3 or 4 days more which the Sachims did accordingly<lb/><lb/>

Children<lb/> As often as we come to  see  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>
Frontiers, and to treat with the Indians, I send for my children  the
Mahikanders to assure them of my fatherly care and affection &amp;  I
am glad to have this opportunity of  renewing  the  ancient  Covenant
Chain which I do in a solemn manner in the name of the Great King  my
Master in the behalf of all His Subjects of North America, Which

<pb n="662"/>

Chain of Friendship I am informed by the Inhabitants of  this  Place
has been kept inviolable by your Ancestors from the first  time  that
Christians settled here in this River &amp;  since  you  have  always
been obedient children &amp; observed the commands of my Predecessors
&amp; been protected by this Government, I do assure you of the  same
Protection of the Great King, so long as you prove obedient children,
which I do not in the least doubt, since you will always find  it  to
be your Interest &amp; Advantage<lb/><lb/>

I need not tell you how destructive your Intemperence has proved  and
how much your people  are  <orig reg="diminished">diminish<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig>  by  your
excessive drinking of Rum the Women as well as the men  being  guilty
of being often drunck, let me advise you to be  more  sober  for  the
future, and not to spend what you get by Hunting on strong drink, but
lay it out on clothing and other necessaries for your  support  &amp;
above all not squander your Indian Corn for Rum which  you  ought  to
keep for your subsistence all the year<lb/><lb/>

I shall conclude by telling you as long as you keep firm to your duty
at all times to come, as you have in times past, you may rest assured
not only of Protection but of all other good offices in the Power  of
those that are in Authority under the King our  common  Father  &amp;
Protector, give a Belt<lb/><lb/>

As soon as you have made your answer I will make  you  a  Present  of

We are glad to see our in Health and that he is come to  see  us.  We
are come pursuant to your commands to hear what you  are  pleased  to
require of us, we rejoice to  hear  that  the  Great  King  of  Great
Britain both think of us &amp; remember such a mean people as we  are
to renew the Covenant Chain with us<lb/><lb/>

We are come now to renew the Covenant Chain  that  has  been  of  old
between the Christians of this Government &amp; us, At first it was a
Tye with our hands joined together, but afterwards we were joined  by
a Covenant Chain which we now brighten &amp; make clear &amp;  clean,
so y<hi rend="super">t</hi> it can never be broken, Give  a  Belt  of

We now renewed &amp;  <orig reg="brightened">brighten<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig>  the  Covenant

<p>
Father<lb/>

We look upon you as a great Tree under whose Branches  we  desire  to
shelter, and if there should happen any  sudden  Tempest  or  Thunder
Shower we hope we shall  be  admitted  to  take  shelter  under  <orig reg="yt">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> great  Tree  &amp;  be  shadowed  by  the  leaves
thereof, that no drops may fall on us but <orig reg="vt">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> we
may live in Peace and safety, Give a Belt of Wampum<lb/><lb/>

We take you as a loving &amp; tender Father &amp; beg leave to inform
you that some of our people that have been  out  a  hunting  to  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  Eastward  have  been  taken  Prisoners  by  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> English of New England, but since his  Excellency
our  Fathers  arrival  here,  we  have   <orig reg="received">rec<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig>
intelligence that they are released. We know not whether that account
be true but hope &amp; wish it may be so, Gave 3 Beavers<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Father<lb/>

As you have been an affectionate  &amp;  loving  Father  to  us  your
Children, so we hope if any  mischeif  should  befall  us,  you  will
resent it &amp; protect your children, and  not  suffer  them  to  be
injured we will not be rash to attempt any thing or too credulous  to
beleive   any   stories   but   first   acquaint    your    <orig reg="Excellency">Excell<hi rend="super">cy</hi></orig> our father &amp; follow your advice  &amp;  obey
your orders Give 3 Beavers<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Father<lb/>

We are sensible that you are much in the right, that Rum does a great
deal of Harm, we approve of all that you said on that Point, but  the
matter is this, When our people come from  Hunting  to  the  Town  or
Plantations and acquaint the Traders &amp; People that we want Powder
and Shot &amp; Clothing, they first give us a large cup of  Rum,  and
after we get the Taste of it crave for more so that in fine  all  the
Beaver &amp; Peltry we have hunted goes for drink, and  we  are  left
destitute either of Clothing or Ammunition, Therefore we  desire  our
father to order the Tap or Crane to be shut &amp;  to  prohibit  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> selling of Rum, for as  long  as  the  Christians
will sell Rum, our People will drink it, do give 3  Beavers<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Father<lb/>

We acknowledge that our Father is very much in the right to  tell  us
that we squander away our Indian Corn which should subsist our  Wives
&amp; Children but one great cause of it is <orig reg="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig>
many of our People are obliged to hire Land of the  Christians  at  a
very dear Rate, to give half the Corn for Rent &amp; the  other  half
they are tempted by Rum  to  sell,  &amp;  so  the  Corn  goes,  <orig reg="yet">y<hi rend="super">t </hi></orig>  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>   Poor   women   &amp;
children are left to shift as well as the can do  give  3  Beavers<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="center">(Ampamit Speaker.)</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Father<lb/>

We have no more Land the Christians when they buy  a  small  spot  of
Land of us, ask us if we have no more Land &amp; when we say yes they
enquire the name of the Land &amp; take in a greater Bounds than  was
intended to be sold them &amp; the Indians not understanding what  is
writ in the Deed or Bill of Sale sign it and are so deprived of  Part
of their Lands — Give 3 Beavers<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="664"/>

<p>
Father<lb/>

In former days when the Christians came to settle this  Country  they
came with a ship &amp; desired to fasten their  Cable  to  the  Hills
near Hosak above Albany, which we readily granted &amp; ever since we
have lived in Friendship &amp; Amity together,  which  we  hope  will
continue so long as Sun &amp; Moon endure Gave 3 Beavers<lb/><lb/>

His Excellency told the River Indians that he was well satisfied with
their renewing the Covenant Chain  &amp;  charged  them  to  keep  it
inviolable to all the Subjects in North America &amp; assured them if
they behaved themselves well &amp; did no injuries to the Christians,
they needed not fear any harm done to them &amp; if they suffered any
Damage by any private  Person  they  should  complain  &amp;  justice
should be done to them as well as to the Christians<lb/><lb/>

The Governor sees that they look better  &amp;  are  better  cloathed
than the other Indians that do not live among  the  Christians  &amp;
therefore that they do well to stay among them He beleives they  live
better since the Christians bought &amp; improved  their  Lands  than
they did before for then the Land lay  waste  &amp;  unimproved.  His
Excellency <orig reg="ordered">order<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> them to divide  the  Presents
that shall now be given them One half for the Indians that live above
Albany &amp; the other half for those that live below Albany<lb/><lb/>

Brethren<lb/>

The hearty concurrance with which you have  received  what  I  lately
proposed to you in the  behalf  of  this  Province  as  well  as  the
Propositions  made  to  you  by  the  Governors  of  Virginia   &amp;
Pensilvania has given us all so  entire  satisfaction,  that  we  now
appear together in the name of all the British Colonies, to shew  you
that as we are all subjects of the Great &amp; Good King  George,  so
we have all one heart &amp; one mind, &amp; that we are  all  jointly
concerned in every thing that relates to one anothers security  &amp;
happiness<lb/>

<pb n="665"/>

This brotherly love it is that is the peculiar distinguishing mark by
which Men may know us to be Christians &amp; by many expressions from
you of the same strain I am inclined to hope you  will  deserve  that
honorable name, if you act up to your Promises, but  since  you  have
acknowledged that  there  is  a  God  who  will  judge  us  <abbr expan="according">accord<hi rend="super">g</hi></abbr> to our Actions remember that he  will  punish  us
severely if we say one thing &amp; do the contrary,  &amp;  that  not
only in another life but in this we may expect that  they  who  break
their Faith will have the Frowns of Heaven upon them &amp;  they  who
keep it shall prosper and flourish &amp; now  since  all  Stains  are
entirely wiped off from the Covenant Chain and that you have resolved
to be sincere for the time to come which is the only way to  keep  it
bright &amp; clean in conjunction  with  these  Governors  I  do  now
solemnly  renew  it  with  you  in  the  name  of  all   his   <abbr expan="Matys">Mat<hi rend="super">ys</hi></abbr> Provinces in North America, Give a Belt<lb/><lb/>

Brethren<lb/>

Since you tell me that you are determined to cleave close to all  the
English I doubt not of your being  thoroughly  incensed  against  the
Eastern Indians who have lately  attacked  your  Brethren  under  the
Government of Boston and contrary to all their repeated [and]  solemn
Treaties and Engagements &amp;  their  frequent  submission  to  that
Government  have  lately   destroyed   several   of   their   Eastern
Settlements, by taking their vessels, burning  their  Houses  Killing
their   Cattle   &amp;   cruelly   murdering    several    of    <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  Inhabitants  which   Insults   were   grown   so
intolerable, that that Government has at last been obliged to declare
Warr against them as Traitors &amp; Rebells<lb/><lb/>

The Governor of Boston  did  some  time  ago  acquaint  me  with  the
Injuries they  had  received  from  those  Indians  &amp;  then  sent
Commissioners with a noble Present which is still  in  this  Town  to
inform you of it &amp; desire you to interpose your good advice  with
those Indians in order to prevent a War. But as there was then no War
actually declared, it was hoped that it would not come to that height
as to require your interposing, and it was thought necessary  that  I
should meet you first myself &amp; know your  intentions  before  any
proposalls of that kind should be made to you &amp; now that  I  find
by conferences with some of you that you  have  no  Engagements  with
those Indians &amp; that you resent the outrage done to your Brethren
the Christians as you ought to do, and since a War  is  now  actually
<orig reg="declared">declar<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig>  I  think  it  necessary  that  without
waiting for Commissioners from Boston, or any other delay you send  a
few Deputys from the 5 Nations to the Eastern  Nations  to  let  them
know that you have heard with indignation how perfidiously they  have
treated your Brethren <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> English &amp; that you
require them forthwith to beg a cessation of arms of  the  Government
of Boston in order to treat of a Peace which will be the only way for
them to avoid the Anger and resentment  of  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>
five Nations who cannot look on unconcerned when their  Brethren  the
English receive such barbarous Treatment, &amp; because there is  now
war between them I have thought it the securest way for you to go  by
the way of Boston with a Christian to accompany you who shall carry a
letter from me to the Governor of Boston &amp;  have  a  Passport  to
shew upon the road thither The Governor of Boston will  then  send  a
party to conduct you safely to the Eastern Indians by which means you
will be secure from any ill accident either through Malice or Mistake
throughout your whole journey, And I do engage  for  that  Government
that they will give a handsome reward to  the  Messengers  besides  a
noble Present to the 5 Nations when the Service is  effected  gave  a
Belt<lb/>

<p>
Brethren<lb/>

We have made a new Law severer than that which was made last year  to
put an effectual Stop to the Trade from Canada for  Indian  Goods  If
any Indian can discover such Goods carrying to Canada  he  may  seize
and bring them to the Commissioners &amp; if he can inform who is the
owner of them, that Owner may by this last Law be obliged to discover
the truth himself, and then the Indian will be entituled  to  receive
one  Hundred  Pounds  besides  the  goods — so  that   there   is
sufficient encouragement to you to stop that Path yourselves  as  far
as relates to Indian Goods which is all that is prejudicial to you in
the Canada Trade<lb/><lb/>

I have for your further Encouragement and to carry on the Trade  with
the Farr  Indians  through  your  Country  despatched  Major  Abraham
Schuyler<ref n="1" target="n666.01"/>
 your old  Friend  to  reside  in  the
Sinnekees Country whom I dont doubt you will embrace as a brother and
receive him in all your counsels  especially  when  any  French  come
among you that he may be ready to detect any false reports which they
would endeavor to infuse into your people<lb/><lb/>

I do not insist on your telling me  particularly  who  have  been  in
Canada contrary to your promises last year, but I am willing to  draw
a cover over your Past faults of every sort But if for the future any
of your people go to Canada I will not look on  those  offenders  any
more as Brethren and I forbid them possitively to come hither  for  I
hate to see any such double hearted Persons, &amp; I expect that they
never have any share of my presents but if the will be Frenchmen, let
them go &amp; be French men entirely, for they will but  deceive  and
corrupt the good Brethren of the 5 Nations, by living with them &amp;
now before I part with you I must  observe  the  ill  consequence  of
bringing such  a  number  of  your  young  people  hither  whom  you
acknowledge that you cannot govern &amp; who do great injuries to the
Inhabitants,  which  has  occasioned  quarrels  &amp;  mischeif,  and
obliges me to order some soldiers to walk round the Town,  to  hinder
any injury to be committed by the Indians on the  Inhabitants  or  by
the Inhabitants on the Indians and that nothing like these  desorders
may happen for the future I do positively command you  not  to  bring
above 60 or 70 persons in all including Sachims  Warriors  young  men
&amp; women when I send for you to meet at this Place I shall then be
able to provide you plentifully with Provisions and such young people
may be found to come along with you for whose good behaviour you  may
answer &amp; upon this I give a Belt<lb/><lb/>

This has been is great &amp; solemn meeting and I hope it will  never
be forgott &amp; that the Covenant Chain will now endure as  long  as
the Rocks &amp; mountains to which it is fastened<lb/><lb/>

I now lay down my present that you may have no further  occasion  to
keep your young men whom I will not permitt to stay longer here since
they were guilty of such insolent Practises last night  and  herewith
command them to begin their  march  directly  out  of  Town  that  no
further disorder may happen &amp; I expect you will send some of your
wise men with them, leaving a sufficient number to answer me<lb/><lb/>

solemn meeting, which we own having  been  made  with  Your  <orig reg="Excellency">Exell<hi rend="super">cy</hi></orig> the  Governors  of  Virginia  &amp;  Pensilvania
&amp; we acknowledge that if these Treaties now  concluded,  be  well
observed by both parties it will be a great Happiness to our children
&amp; Childrens Children as for our parts we  are  resolved  to  keep
&amp; maintain whatever has  been  concluded  now,  &amp;  stipulated
between us all &amp; shall imprint it on our Posterity to be by  them
kept inviolable for ever<lb/><lb/>

Brother Corlaer<lb/>

We will answer the Principal Heads of your Propositions  made  to  us
yesterday you renewed the Covenant Chain in Conjunction with the  two
other   Governors   of   Virginia   &amp;   Pensilvania,   in    <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> behalf of  all  the  English  Colonies  of  North
America all which we do in like manner in  the  behalf  of  the  five
Nations &amp; do resolve to keep and maintain the same for  ever  and
if there be any spots or Stains thereon or any Rust come upon it  [we
do now wipe off the same and brighten it that] it may  be  clear  and
lasting to all future ages<lb/><lb/>

<p>Brother Corlaer<lb/>

When the Christians first came to this Country our Ancestors fastened
the ship that brought them behind a Great Mountain with  a  Chain  in
order to secure the same which mountain  lyes  behind  the  Sinnekees
Country, so that the one end of the Chain, being fastened  there  and
the other end at <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Ship,  if  any  body  would
steal away &amp; molest this ship the chain will jingle &amp; make  a
noise &amp; so alarm all the 5 Nations who  are  bound  to  defend
this ship &amp; this is the foundation &amp; original of the Covenant
Chain among the 5 Nations, which our ancestors  made,  which  was  to
preserve this ship from any harm gave a Belt of  Wampum

<p id="n668">Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You acquainted us yesterday how  villanously  &amp;  barbarously  the
Eastern Indians had fallen upon  our  Brethren  the  English  of  New
England &amp; murdered <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> people for  which  we
are much concerned and sorrowfull and according  as  you  require  in
your Proposition we have <orig reg="pitched">pitch<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> upon an  Indian
of each nation to go to Boston  &amp;  so  to  be  conducted  to  the
Eastward &amp; acquaint those Indians with what indignation we  heard
of their base Treatment of our Brethren &amp;  command  them  to  beg
peace of the English of New England and since we have not a  Belt  to
give in return for that Belt you gave us upon  this  Proposition,  we
intend to make use of that Belt you gave us yesterday to the  Eastern
Indians when we communicate to them our Intentions that  we  can  not
look unconcerned when  our  Brethren  of  New  England  receive  such
barbarous Treatment<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

You told us yesterday that we were not to go to Canada  or  have  any
correspondence with them, but those that would go thither, they might
stay there for altogether, and not return to deceive and corrupt  the
5 Nations, but we remember it has been recommended to us formerly  to
have Peace &amp; amity with all People, even the  farr  Indians  that
are in Friendship with the French &amp; to draw them  to  come  &amp;
Trade in this Government and accordingly we have followed that advice
&amp; the French being in Alliance with the English &amp; in Peace we
hope it may not be of any ill consequence if at any time some of  our
People  went  thither  to  retain  that   good   understanding   <orig reg="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> is among us. As long  as  none  goes  thither  to
betray their country nor their Allies, since it is Common &amp;  the
Practice every where when Nations are in Peace &amp; Amity  with  one
another to go &amp; visit each other for if we should wholly  refrain
from going thither, would it not be of bad  consequence  to  us  some
time or other therefore we hope it will not be ill taken if sometimes
some of our People should go thither<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Corlaer<lb/>

As to your Excellency's Proposals yesterday relating  to  the  severe
Law made prohibiting the sending Indian goods to Canada,  &amp;  what
encouragement is given to any person whatever who should discover the
same, in answer to which we say, that we will not  concern  ourselves
any ways in <orig reg="yt">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> affair. We are peaceable People
&amp; inclined to Peace &amp; if we should intermeddle  in  any  such
matter, we should but create ourselves a  great  many  enemies  &amp;
therefore desire to be excused<lb/><lb/>

As to the Proposition relating to our People  coming  in  such  great
numbers here, when any publick affairs are to be transacted,  we  own
it is of bad consequence, as we find by experience, by mischeif  done
by our ungovernable young men,  both  in  Town  &amp;  Country  &amp;
therefore we accept very kindly &amp; approve of what you propose  of
sending no more in the whole but 60 or 70 Persons or such a number as
the Messenger shall acquaint us withall, when he comes to  call  down
the 5 Nations to treat here at Albany &amp; thereupon gave a Belt  of
Wampum<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Lastly say Brother Corlaer<lb/>

We have told you at large the first settlement of the Christians here
&amp; how at first we  traded  together  &amp;  afterwards  made  the
Covenant Chain &amp; how cheap we had goods at first &amp;  how  much
dearer we pay for the same sort of Goods now &amp; moreover that  the
Powder is not only dear but bad <orig reg="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig>  we  cannot
kill the Peltry with [it] which is the Christians Dammage as well  as
ours — We have heard that our Great King George is  a  very  good
Man &amp; our friend and sends

<pb n="669"/>

that which is good but we are afraid that our Brethren the Christians
that live here do abuse us when they Trade with us, hope there may be
some method found out to prevent it<lb/><lb/>

His Excellency the Governor made them a short Answer viz<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brethren<lb/>

There is occasion to answer some things that you have said to me tho'
the most Part is what I like very well<lb/><lb/>

The reason why I have advised you against trading with the French  is
because they cheat you always &amp; take advantages in time of  Peace
in order to weaken you by advising you to warr  against  the  English
Indians, that when a war breaks out  you  may  be  an  easy  prey  to
them<lb/><lb/>

It is the Handlers or Traders that furnish you  with  Goods,  and  if
they give you too little the Government can't help it, but  you  know
that the French are still harder upon you, and sell goods much dearer
&amp; if you don't stop the Path to Canada as I  advised  you  it  is
your own faults that Goods are not  cheaper  for  if  that  Trade  be
stopped there will be more goods to  be  sold  to  you  and  at  more
reasonable Rates<lb/><lb/>

I insist upon it that those who go to Canada do not  come  hither  or
receive any part of my Presents to you for  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>

Sachims &amp; Warriors of <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  5  Nations<lb/><lb/>

You often say that your Covenant Chain with Virginia is grown  rusty,
&amp; have urged of late years, that  some  Commissioners  from  that
Colony should be sent to this Place to brighten the same<lb/><lb/>

This is an old Story which the People of Virginia  remember  to  have
been continually rung in their ears &amp; are sensible that  none  of
the many Treaties which they have made for near fifty years past have
ever been long observed on the Part of the 5 Nations Wherefore  I  am
now come hither as Governor of Virginia accompanied by  some  members
of that Government in order to try if our Covenant Chain cannot be so
polished  as  never  more  to  grow  rusty  &amp;  to   endeavor   at
establishing an  everlasting  Peace  between  your  People  and  ours
comprehending not only the Christian Inhabitants of Virginia but also
the several Nations of Indians belonging to and

<pb n="670"/>

subject to that Government &amp; according  to  the  custom  of  this
Place, I signify to you this Proposition by giving 2 Belts of Wampum,
<orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> one for the Government of Virginia &amp; the
other for all its tributary Indians<lb/><lb/>

Nothing but your assuredly promising (as you did here  last  year  to
your Governor) that you  would  agree  to  the  Preliminary  Articles
offered by Virginia could have  perswaded  that  Government  to  send
hither to treat with you and therefore before I enter upon any  other
matter, I expect you to ratify &amp; confirm that principle  article
which you have declared that you will faithfully observe  If  I  take
care that our Indians perform the same on their Part  Viz  "That  the
great River of Potowmak &amp;  the  High  Ridge  of  Mountains  which
extend all along the Frontiers of Virginia to  the  Westward  of  the
present Settlements of that Colony shall be for ever the  established
Boundaries between the Indians subject to the  Dominion  of  Virginia
&amp; the Indians belonging to and depending on  the  5  Nations:  So
that neither our Indians shall on any pretence whatsoever pass to the
Northward or Westward  of  the  said  Boundaries  without  having  to
produce a Passport, under the  Hand  and  Seal  of  the  Governor  or
<orig reg="Commander">Command<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> in Cheif of Virginia nor your  Indians
pass to the Southward or Eastward of the said  Boundaries  without  a
Passport in like Manner from the Governor or Commander  in  Cheif  of
New York"<lb/><lb/>

Now not only our Indians have given us  solemn  assurances  of  their
keeping within the prescribed Limits but we have also by this act  of
Assembly taken such measures for their due performance  of  the  same
that the Government of Virginia  undertakes  and  engages  for  their
nations in this Particular, so that nothing remains but  that  the  5
Nations ratifie &amp; confirm the said Article, which I expect should
be done in a Solemn manner not only by their Sachims but also by  all
their  Warriors   here   present   &amp;   for   that   purpose   <hi rend="italics">I offer you this fine Coronet</hi> as a singular  Token
to be held up in the Presence of  all  who  are  upon  this  occasion

People Present at the same time give a shout to be taken as a  Signal
Testimony of their Concurrence besides I will have it signed by  your
Sachims &amp; myself before I will either propose or present you with
any thing further on the part of Virginia<lb/><lb/>

We the Sachims of the five Nations, The Mohogs,  Oneydes,  Onnondages
Cayouges &amp; Sinnekees, together with the Tuscarores are come  here
upon His <orig reg="Excellency">Excell<hi rend="super">cy</hi></orig> the  Governor  of  New  Yorks
message<lb/><lb/>

We have heard the Proposition of the Governor of Virginia with  great
attention &amp; considered it very maturely, but before we answer  we
must impart what  our  ancestors  have  done  with  respect  to  this
Government<lb/><lb/>

When the Christians first came here, they came in a great ship, &amp;
we were glad of their coming &amp; fastened the Ship behind  a  great
Tree &amp; our business then was trading and Merchandize<lb/><lb/>

And considering the benefit thereof &amp; that the Tree to which  the
Ship was <orig reg="fastened">fastn<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> might  rot,  &amp; so  let  the
Ship go we carried the Anchor behind a great  Mountain,  that  so  we
might keep it forever, and it was we that desired the  Christians  to
come to settle among us &amp; not they<lb/><lb/>

The third thing that was done by the Christians &amp; our  Ancestors,
after they understood one an other was to enter into  a  Covenant  of
Friendship which they called the Covenant Chain &amp; to the best of
our Knowledge that Covenant has been kept by both parties  from  that
time to this, And both  our  Ancestors  were  so  prudent  that  they
stipulated and agreed that if any bad accidents  or  mischeif  should
happen on either side it should be forgot &amp; forgiven and not make
a Breach in <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Covenant Chain<lb/><lb/>

Brother Assarigoe<lb/> When the neighbouring Governments of Virginia
&amp; Pensilvania and New England found how well we agreed they  were
glad to link their Hands in the same Covenant Chain &amp; there  were
two Places Viz Albany &amp; Onnoudague appointed to meet at &amp;  to
settle a right understanding in case any mischief  should  happen  of
either side<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Assarigoe<lb/>

We will not make any further mention of these old Stories of what Our
Ancestors did but will now  come  to  the  Point  &amp;  answer  your
Propositions &amp; the hope if our answer should not be  given  with
that respect &amp; regard which is your due  you  will  excuse  us<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>
Brother Assarigoe<lb/>

You told us some days ago  that  the  five  Nations  say  that  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Covenant Chain which was made betwixt  us,  &amp;
Virginia fifty years ago is grown rusty &amp; that we  did  not  long
keep or observe the Condition of it &amp; you have forbid us to  pass
the Southside  of  the  Great  River  Kahongoronton  which  you  call
Potowmack or to the East side of the great Ridge of  Mountains  which
extend all along the Frontiers of Virginia<lb/><lb/>

In the first place we agree to this Article &amp; faithfully  promise
not to pass over the great River  Kahongoronton  which  the  English
call Potowmack nor the great Rid[g]e of Mountains which extend  along
your Frontiers we are glad to find you are come  here  to  renew  the
Peace  as  well  in  the   behalf   of   the   Christians   as   <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Indians of Virginia We wish you had brought  some
of <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Sachims of your Indians that  they  might
have spoke to us face to face &amp; have put  their  hands  into  the
Covenant Chain, but since you are come here we agree to accept  what
you offer in their behalf in the same manner as if they were present,
and tho' there is a Nation amongst you, the Toderechrones  (Christian
Indians<ref n="1" target="n671.01"/>)  against  whom  we   have   had   so
inveterate an enmity, that we  thought  it  impossible  it  could  be
extinguished, but by a total

<pb n="672"/>

Extirpation of them, yet since  you  desire  it  we  are  willing  to
receive them into this Peace &amp; to forgive  all  that  is  past<lb/><lb/>

It has pleased God to make you Christians &amp; us  Heathens  but  we
hope we shall both act according to our capacities &amp; be  faithful
to our respîve Promises &amp; engagements, Some are  placed  in  High
Stations &amp; some in low, but there is  one  above  who  rules  and
Governs all &amp; will judge us according to our Actions<lb/><lb/>

We hope you will observe that your Indians  which  you  have  engaged
for, perform what you have promised for them That they shall not pass
to the Norward of the River Kahongaronton, nor to the Westward of the
Great Ridge of Mountains &amp; as you gave us two Belts one from  the
Christians &amp; the other from the Indians of Virginia  so  we  give
you two Belts one for  your  Christians  &amp;  the  other  for  your
Indians<lb/><lb/>

It is some time agoe since you made this Proposition to us &amp;  you
must not take it amiss that we have not answered you before, It was a
thing of great importance &amp; fit to be well considered, and it  is
now agreed not only by all our Sachims, but also by all our  Warriors
as well those which are absent as those which are present<lb/><lb/>

You have told us that we may pass the great River Kahongoronton &amp;
the Great Ridge of Mountains provided we have  a  Passport  from  the
Governor of New York and we promise you again, not  to  pass  to  the
Southward  or  Eastward  of  the  said  Boundaries  without  such   a
Passport<lb/><lb/>

You told us after this you had something further to propose, relating
to the General Peace which we  hope  you  will  now  speak  sincerely
without Dissimulation<lb/><lb/>

You told us you had a Coronet, which you would have held  up  by  our
speaker &amp; that at the same time we should make a shout as a token
of our consent to this Article which we are now ready to do<lb/><lb/>

And we are now ready since you told us you were  not  satisfied  with
our words in this matter of consequence to sign your Propositions  in
the most publick manner<lb/><lb/>

All which was performed accordingly &amp; the  Speaker  of  the  Five
Nations holding up the Coronet they gave six Shouts five for the five
Nations &amp; one for a castle of Tuscarores  lately  seated  between
Oneyde &amp; Onnondage<lb/><lb/>

And a Memorandum was made under the Propositions of the  Governor  of
Virginia importing that one the  sixth  day  of  September  1722  the
Sachims &amp; Warriors of  the  five  Nations  together  with  divers
cheifs of the Tuscarores made their answer by Ondaghsighte  a  Sachim
of Oneyde their Speaker Chosen for that purpose  &amp;  did  solemnly
declare the assent of the whole 5 Nations  including  the  Tuscarores
&amp; fully agreed to the said Propositions  relating  to  the  Peace
&amp; Boundaries &amp; that in Testimony thereof  they  held  up  the
Coronet &amp; signed these Propositions<lb/><lb/>

Since the Bounds between your Indians &amp; ours  are  firmly  agreed
upon tis necessary now to declare the names of the several Nations of
Indians which the Government of Virginia engages for, &amp; those are
the Nottoways, Meherins, Nanemonds,<ref n="1" target="n673.01"/>
Pamunkeys,  Chichominys,  &amp; the  Christanna  Indians  whom  you  call  Todirichroones   that   we
comprehend under the name,<ref n="2" target="n673.02"/> the Saponies,  Ochineeches,  Stenkenocks,
Meipontskys &amp; Toteroes, all the forenamed  Indians  having  their
present Settlements on the East Side of the high Ridge  of  Mountains
&amp; between the two Great Rivers of Potomack &amp;  Roanoke,  which
you call Kahongaronton &amp; Konentcheneke &amp; on the other hand it
is fit at this time that you declare <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  names
of all those Indians whom you comprehend in the present Treaty  &amp;
for whose Performance the five Nations will answer<lb/><lb/>

And to mind you of this Proposition I lay down for our ten Nations of

I have already told you <orig reg="yt">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> we have made  a  Law
in Virginia to oblige a due performance of  <orig reg="yt">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig>
Article of the Boundaries which you have ratified &amp; it is  highly
expedient that I now particularly inform you thereof<lb/><lb/>

If any Indians of the aforenamed Nations  belonging  to  Virginia  or
those whom you declare to be dependent on  your  five  Nations  shall
hereafter transgress the said Boundaries without  having  the  proper
Passeports already mentioned every such Indian is by that Law  liable
to be put to death or transported &amp; sold for a slave &amp; as the
Government of Virginia will not demand satisfaction for whatever  you
shall do to any of their Indians whom you shall  take  on  the  North
Side of Potowmack River &amp; on the West Side of the high  Ridge  of
Mountains so your people must not look upon it as any Breach  of  the
Peace &amp; Friendship which Virginia desires to  preserve  with  the
five Nations, if that Government shall hang or transport any of  your
Indians who shall hereafter be taken without a proper Passport on the
South Side of the said River &amp; on  the  east  Side  of  the  said
Ridge, And I cannot but think that the wiser  sort  of  your  People
must  approve  of  a  Law  that  will  oblige  your   foolish   &amp;
ungovernable young men to hearken (better than they always have done)
to the sage Council of the Elders &amp; to observe more punctually a
Treaty which their Sachims have thought fit to make for them  and  in

being bound by this Law <hi rend="italics">I  give  fifteen  Guns</hi>

Sachims &amp; Warriors<lb/>

It appears to be a method agreed upon by your five Nations to receive
no proposalls, nor have any manner of Treaty with any of the  English
Provinces, than through the Government  of  New  York  to  which  you
belong, wherefore Virginia expects you should observe the  same  Rule
with Respect to that Government &amp; that you should not at any time
offer to treat with the Indians belonging to that Colony but through
the Government there &amp; if you should come  to  Virginia  with  an
intent to treat with our Indians in  any  other  manner,  though  you
should have Passport from the Government of New York, you must expect
it will be held void, &amp; you  will  be  treated  as  if  you  came
without it &amp; with this Proposition I give you a Belt<lb/><lb/>

You sent me last year a  Belt  of  Wampum  as  a  Testimony  of  your
Promise, that you would seize and  carry  to  Virginia  some  Runaway
Negroes, belonging to that Colony, whenever you did discover and meet
with them in the woods, Now I make a general Proposition  to  you  on
account of Runnaways &amp; Slaves belonging to Virginia viz  that  if
any such Negroe or Slave shall hereafter fall  into  your  hands  you
shall straigtway  conduct  them  to  <abbr expan="Coll:"> Coll: </abbr>  George  Masons  House  on
Potowmack River &amp; I do in behalf of that Colony engage  that  you
shall there receive immediately  upon  the  delivery  of  every  such
Runaway one good Gun &amp; two Blankets, or the value thereof,  &amp;
in Token of this Proposition and Engagement <hi rend="italics">I  lay
down 5 Guns &amp; 500 flints</hi><lb/><lb/>

You sent this year to demand of  Virginia  four  Indian  boys  to  be
delivered up to you for four of your Messengers  which  you  alledged
our  Indians  had  poisoned  Whereupon  I  must  tell  you  that  the
Government has absolutely rejected your demands &amp; is  too  strong
&amp; powerful to be scared by <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  threats  of
the five Nations into any unjust compliance &amp; I am here ready  to
justify not only our Indians against this charge, but also to  answer
for the Colony of Virginia &amp; give all due satisfaction if you can
make it appear that the<ref n="1" target="n674.01"/>
 people have ever broke  the  Covenant  Chain with any of the 5 Nations<lb/><lb/>

And to put you in mind of what I say on this Head  I  lay  down  five
bundles of Beds<ref n="2" target="n674.02"/>
<lb/><lb/>

On the other hand I came here  to  accuse  the  People  of  the  five
Nations of divers hostilities, Robberies &amp; Repeated  Breeches  of
their Treaties but since you have declared your desire that all  past
offences should be forgiven &amp; forgott &amp; have now on your part
readily  passed  over  an  injury  received  from  a   Christian   in
Pensylvania &amp; more especially seeing you have so fully  concurred
in my Propositions of the Boundaries, which  if  duly  observed  must
effectually prevent all future disorders &amp; Injuries to Virginia I
shall at this Juncture forbear all particular  Charges  against  you,
except only that I must say you have so greatly  wronged  the  person
(<abbr expan="Captain"> Capt<hi rend="super">n</hi></abbr> Robert Hicks) when you killed his  Negro
with  about  seventy  of  his  horses  &amp;  plundered  him   of   a
considerable cargoe of Goods, that to shew the five nations have  any
sense  of  Justice  they  cannot  but  make  him  some  amends  &amp;
Reparation for his losses<lb/><lb/>

You are come six hundred miles to treat with us &amp; we are glad  to
see you You have made your Propositions to us  wherein  you  call  us
Sachims &amp; Warriors of the five Nations, &amp; acquainted us since
we had agreed not to pass the  River  Kahongoronton,  nor  the  great
Ridge of Mountains, that there is a Law in Virginia prohibiting us to
pass that River  or  those  Mountains  under  the  Penalty  of  being
transported or sold for Slaves, or put to death We do assure  you  we
are very well  satisfied  with  that  Law  &amp;  desire  that  those
Boundaries may be for ever observed, You have also told us  that  you
will engage for ten Nations of Indians in Virginia, that  they  shall
not Pass to the North side of the  River  Kahongoronton  nor  to  the
Westward of the Great Ridge of Mountains &amp; that if we should meet
with any of them without those Boundaries, we might use  them  as  we
thought fit, without Breaking this  Peace  notwithstanding  which  we
assure you if any of your Indians shall happen in our way we will not
hurt them, but treat them as friends &amp;  give  them  victuals,  so
desirous we are of being at Peace with them<lb/><lb/>

River you likewise told us, that we had made it a Rule not  to  treat
with any of the  Neighbouring  Governments  but  at  Albany,  so  you
expected we should not treat  with  your  Indians  but  through  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e </hi></orig> <abbr expan="Government">Goverm<hi rend="super">t</hi></abbr> of  Virginia  &amp;
that tho' we should come with a Pass we  must  not  treat  separately
with those Indians for <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> Pass would be  looked
upon as void if we should We agree to  this  Proposition  &amp;  promise that we will not at any  time  make  any  Treaty  with  the  Virginia Indians  without  first  acquainting  the  Governor  therewith  &amp; hereupon we give a Belt<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brother Assarigoe<lb/>

You told us yesterday that you would not sum up  any  of  our  former
Misdeeds but would forgive all that  is  passed  We  acknowledge  our
People have been guilty of a great many bad  actions  &amp;  heartily
thank you that you are so good as to forgive them &amp;  as  to  that
honest man <abbr expan="Captain"> Capt<hi rend="super">n</hi></abbr> Hicks we own  our  people  did
rob him of a very considerable booty &amp; did him a  great  deal  of
Mischeif, but by an accident that befel us afterwards it happened  we
got very little by it for the woods being very dry by the  negligence
of some of our own people took fire &amp; thereby we  lost  the  most
part of what we had taken:  Nevertheless  when  we  are  able  we  do
promise to make that poor man some reparation for his  loss,  but  at
this juncture we are not in a capacity of doing it We have now made a
Peace with you &amp; we  hope  it  will  be  kept  by  us  &amp;  our
Children's Children for ever &amp; thereupon we give a Belt<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brother Assarigoe<lb/>

As to the Proposition you made relating to Negroes We promise that if
any Runaway Negroes or slaves shall happen to fall into our hands  we
will  carry  them  to  <abbr expan="Coll:"> Coll: </abbr>  Masons  on  Potowmack  River  for  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> reward you proposed: But  as  to  those  Negroes
which you said we promised last year to send home we  hope  you  will
excuse us because they lye very much out of our way &amp; may be  had
more easily by other Indians Yet if we  can  serve  Virginia  in  any
other thing we shall be glad of an opportunity of doing  it<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Now Brother Assarigoe<lb/>

Since we are resolved in case we should find  any  of  your  Virginia
Indians  on  the  Westside   of   the   Great   Mountains   or   <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> North side of the River Kahongoronton not  to  do
them any hurt, we desire that you would  tell  them  when  they  make
fires beyond any of those Boundaries, to lay a  stone  in  them  when
they leave their quarters &amp; we will do  <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>
same, which will be a sign to us both  <orig reg="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig>  our
friends have passed<lb/><lb/>

And lastly we desire that this Peace may be  kept  by  us  &amp;  our
Childrens Children who will rejoice for  the  making  and  concluding
thereof We have a small Present to  make  you  &amp;  hope  you  will
accept of it tho' it is a small one &amp; excuse us that we  are  not
able to give more — And then  they  gave  some  furs  &amp;  Dear
Skins<lb/><lb/>

The Governor told them they had taken no notice of  that  Proposition
wherein he mentioned their demand of four Indian boys to be delivered
up to them for four of their Messengers which they  had  charged  the
Virginia Indians with Poisoning and desired to know whether they were
satisfied that that accusation was  not  just —  To  which  they
answered that they were well assured it was not so that  one  of  the
Persons who went with those Indians to  Virginia,  was  then  present
&amp; they were satisfied they died natural deaths &amp; had  nothing
to accuse Virginia of<lb/><lb/>

The Governor thanked them for their Present, &amp; said  he  did  not
look upon it according to its value, but accepted it  as  if  it  had
been much more. He said he wished it had been greater

<pb n="677"/>

only on account of Captain Hicks to  whom  he  gave  it  as  a  small
Satisfaction of the damage he had sustained by the five Nations. Then
they wished him a good voyage whom &amp; told him they should be glad
to hear of his safe arrival<lb/><lb/>

Then the Governor told them he must take particular notice  of  their
speaker &amp; <hi rend="italics">gave him  a  golden  Horse  Shoe</hi>
which he wore at his Breast &amp; bid the Interpreter tell him  there
was an inscription upon [it] which signified that it  would  help  to

come to Virginia with a Pass they should bring it with them<lb/><lb/>

Brethren<lb/>

I have travelled a great way to see you &amp; to hold some  Discourse
with you the people of Pensylvania have always been  friends  to  the
five Nations they have punctually observed all their former  Treaties
<abbr expan="with">w<hi rend="super">t</hi></abbr> you. They expect that you do not forget them
&amp; therefore I am come to brighten the chain between us, you  sent
me word that you desired to see me and I have obtained  leave  of  my
brother, the Governor of New York to renew our former Treaties  [with
you] at this Place &amp; I am glad he is  present  with  us  to  hear
&amp; observe all that is spoken, Some of your ancient  men  can  yet
remember the first Settlement of  the  Province  of  Pensylvania,  by
William Penn, he was a good man &amp; had a great affection  for  all
Indians, he entered into Leagues of Friendship with them as  Brethren
&amp; he gave it in charge to his Governors whom he left in his Place
&amp; to all his people that they should continue  to  do  the  same,
Divers great men from the five  Nations  have  on  several  occasions
visited us at Philadelphia and Conestogoe we were always glad to  see
them and treated them kindly like Brethren they made firm

<pb n="678"/>

leagues of friendship with us and frequently renewed and strengthened
them we became as one People and hope always to continue  so  and  as
often as the five Nations renewed their League with our  great  &amp;
good friends the Governors of New York it still  united  them  more
nearly to us as being subjects of one and the same great  King.  Last
summer that wise and good man  Ghesaont  with  some  others  of  your
people came in the name of all  the  five  Nations  to  visit  us  at
Conestogoe we received them with joy and opened our  hearts  to  each
other he rejoiced to see us and our Indians live  in  so  much  Peace
together We brightened the Chain that it might be  clear  strong  and
lasting as the Sun &amp; Stars, but when we heard that Ghesaont  died
in Virginia we were very sorry, yet I hope the five Nations  received
my Words of Love &amp; Friendship to their Sachims &amp; to all  your
people with the Golden Medal &amp; the Presents then delivered it was
then stipulated and agreed between us  that  we  should  all  be  one
people <abbr expan="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></abbr> the five Nations  should  not  do  an
injury to any of us more than to themselves &amp; that we should  not
do an injury to any of the five Nations more than to our  own  people
or if any person did such injury, they should be punished for  it  in
the same manner as if done to an Englishman<lb/><lb/>

Since that time a very unhappy accident has fallen out which gave  us
great greif Last winter we heard that one of  the  five  Nations  had
lost his Life by means of some of our People &amp; the very next  day
after the news came to me at Philadelphia, I sent two of  my  Council
to Conestogoe to enquire into [the matter and bring me]<ref n="1" target="n678.01"/>
  the  truth,
they found that the quarrel arose about Rum between a Brother of  the
five Nations who hunted near Potowmack &amp; two of our  Traders  the
Indian was angry &amp; went hastely &amp; took his Gun  to  kill  the
Englishmen, they in defence of themselves seized the Indian &amp;  in
struggling gave him some blows &amp; left him, We  heard  our  Indian
friend and brother died the next day the men who did this action were
brought to Philadelphia &amp; put in prison &amp; they will be  tried
according to our Laws, in <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> same manner as  if
they had killed an Englishman &amp; to prevent such mischeifs for the
future we have made a severe law against selling Rum to the  Indians.
Though this misfortune gave us great greif yet we are  perswaded  the
Cheif Sachims of the five  Nations  are  so  wise  as  to  know  such
accidents may  happen  without  any  ill  design  among  the  nearest
Brethren &amp; by this they will see how strictly we keep our Leagues
&amp; Treaties in punishing those who  shall  dare  to  offend  &amp;
injure them or any of their people, I made haste to send a message to
<orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> five nations by  Sachichoe  to  express  our
Sorrow &amp; received their kind answer by the  return  of  the  same
Messenger, you received our message like true Brethren desiring us to
wipe  away  our  Tears  &amp;  invited  me  to  come  &amp;  see  you
immediately I sent Sachiloe back with this answer that I  would  meet
you at Albany with my good friend [s] the  Governor[s]  of  New  York
&amp; Virginia &amp; I sent some tokens to your Sachims which I  hope
they received  with  a  mourning  Gold  Ring  of  my  own  finger  to
Sacaunkehaute, Sahichoe returned speedily &amp;  said  you  would  be
glad to see me at Albany he  also  told  me  you  desired  that  John
Cartright<ref n="2" target="n678.02"/>
   might   be   released   out   of   prison   &amp;   <abbr expan="yet">y<hi rend="super">t</hi></abbr> the injury done to your kinsman may  be  forgott.
But Sachichoe brought no Belt nor other token to  confirm  his  words
&amp; therefore I have brought him along with me that  you  may  know
and tell me if he spoke Truth. Brethren you see I am come  here  with
four of my Councells to visit you I have left my family &amp;  People
&amp; have travelled a great way to take you  by  the  hand  to  join
hearts &amp; to rejoice in seeing each others faces  for  all  clouds
&amp; darkness must be done  away,  that  the  flame  of  Love  &amp;

had made with <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> five Nations  and  treat  them
with love &amp; kindness we  acknowledge  that  his  Governors  &amp;
People have always kept the same honestly &amp; truly unto this  day,
so we on our parts always have kept &amp; for ever  shall  keep  firm
Peace &amp; Friendship with  a  good  Heart  to  all  the  people  of
Pensylvania, We thankfully receive &amp; approve of all the  articles
in your Proposition to us &amp; acknowledge them  to  be  good  &amp;
full of Love we receive &amp; approve of  the  same  with  our  whole
hearts because we are not only made one People by the Covenant Chain,
but we also are People united in one head one body &amp; one Heart by
the strongest Tyes of Love &amp; friendship<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brother Onas<lb/>

You desire there may be a perpetual Peace  &amp;  friendship  between
you &amp; the five  Nations  and  between  your  children  &amp;  our
children &amp; that the same may be kept as  long  as  the  mountains
&amp; Rivers endure; all which we like well and on  our  Part  desire
that the Covenant &amp; Union made with  a  clean  &amp;  true  Heart
between you and us may last as long  as  the  sun  &amp;  moon  shall
continue to give light &amp; we will deliver this in  charge  to  our
children that it may be kept in Remembrance with their  children  and
childrens children to the latest ages and we desire  that  the  Peace
and Tranquillity that is now established between us, may be as  clear
as the sun shining in its Lustre without any cloud or darkness  &amp;
that the same may continue for ever<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brother Onas<lb/>

We have well considered all that you have spoken &amp; like it  well,
because it is only renewing the former leagues  &amp;  Treaties  made
between the Government of Pensylvania &amp; us of  the  five  Nations
which we always beleived we were obliged  to  keep,  And  as  to  the
accident of one of our friends being killed by some  of  your  people
which has happened by Misfortune, &amp; against your Will we say that
as we are all in Peace we think it hard the  Person  who  killed  our
friend and brother should suffer &amp; we do in the name of  all  the
five nations forgive that offence  &amp;  desire  you  will  likewise
forgive it &amp; that the men who did it may be released from  Prison
&amp; set a[t] liberty to go  whither  they  please  &amp;  we  shall
esteem that as a mark of your regard &amp;  friendship  for  ye  live
Nations &amp; as a further confirmation of this Treaty<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="681"/>

<p>Brother Onas<lb/>

We say further we are glad to hear the former Treaties we  have  made
with William Penn repeated to us again and renewed by you,  &amp;  we
esteem &amp; love you as if you were William Penn himself we are glad
you have wiped away and covered<orig reg="ye"> y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig> blood of our
dead friend &amp; brother &amp; we desire the same may be forgott  so
as it may never be more mentioned or remembered<lb/><lb/>

It is needless for us to answer every particular of your Proposition,
because we acknowledge the whole to be good  and  acceptable  to  us,
Especially your good advice which we  will  always  remember  and  in
Testimony thereof and as a full confirmation of our agreement consent
&amp; approbation &amp; all that you have proposed &amp; we have here
said and promised we lay down a few  Beaver  Bear  &amp;  drest  Deer
Skins and so concluded<lb/><lb/>

Then the Governor expressd his Satisfaction with their  answer  &amp;
gave them thanks for their good will &amp; love to him and <orig reg="ye">y<hi rend="super">e</hi></orig>  People of Pensylvania<lb/><lb/>

The Indians then desired to know of the Governor if the men who  were
in Prison for killing their friend &amp; brother were  discharged  to
which the Governor answered that they were let out  upon  Bails  they
then desired that the men might be discharged to which  the  Governor
answered that as soon as he returned to Philadelphia  he  would  give
such orders in that affair as should fully answer the request of  the
five nations in order to confirm the Friendship that  is  so  happily
renewed &amp; established by this Treaty.<lb/><lb/>

<!-- There is a footnote in this paragraph, after  the final line of text.  I think that it will be unnecessary to include it.

And this is the footnote:

[Here follows the Fourth day's Conference between  the  Five  Nations
and Lieutenant Governor Nanfan, dated the 19th  July,  1701,  already
printed     in      Vol.      IV.,      904-906.      q.v. &#8212; <orig reg="Ed">E<hi
