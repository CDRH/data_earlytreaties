<p>ARTICLE XIX. An agent of the Confederate States and an interpreter shall be continued to be appointed for the Creek Nation, both of whom shall reside at the agency; and whenever a vacancy shall occur in either of the said offices, the authorities of the nation shall be consulted as to the person to be appointed to fill the same, and no one shall be appointed against whom they in good faith protest; and the agent may be removed on petition and formal charges preferred by the constituted authorities of the nation, the President being satisfied, upon full investigation, that there is sufficient cause shown for such removal.</p>

<p rend="center"><!-- <font color="red" size="-1"> --><hi rend="italics">To the treaty concluded between the Confederate States of America and the Creek Nation of Indians, at the North Fork Village, in the Creek Nation, on the tenth day of July, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one.</hi></p>

<!-- <p rend="right">July 10, 1861.</p> -->

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>Preamble.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>ARTICLE. The survivors now residing in the Creek Nation, of the Apalachicola Band of Indians, have earnestly represented to the commissioner of the Confederate States the facts following, that is to say:</p>

<p>That the Apalachicola Band of Indians, being by origin a part of the Creek Nation, long resided on the Apalachicola river, in what is now the State of Florida, and were parties to the treaty concluded at camp Moultrie with the Florida tribes of Indians, on the eighteenth day of September, A. D., one thousand eight hundred and twenty three.</p>

<p>That by two treaties, made and concluded with the United States on the eighteenth day of June, A. D., one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, by different portions of the said Apalachicola Band, the chiefs and warriors of that band relinquished all the privileges to which they were entitled as parties to the treaty aforesaid, concluded at camp Moultrie and all their right and title to certain reservations by it secured to them; and in consideration of that cession, the United States agreed to grant, and to convey within three years, by patent, to certain named chiefs, for the benefit of themselves and of the sub chiefs and warriors of the said Apalachicola Band the quantity, in all, of six sections of land, to be laid off under the direction of the President, after the lands should have been surveyed.</p>

<p>That it was provided by the same two treaties that the said six sections of land might be disposed of by the chiefs, with the consent and advice of the Governor of Florida, at any time before the expiration of said term of three years, and that the said band might thereupon migrate to a country of their choice. And it was further thereby provided, that if, at any future time, the chiefs and warriors of the Apalachicola Band should feel disposed to migrate from Florida to the Creek and Seminole country west, they might either sell the grants of land made by those treaties, and in that case must, themselves, bear the whole expense of their migration, subsistence, &amp;c.; or they might surrender to the United States all the rights and privileges acquired under said two treaties, in which case, they should become parties to the obligations, provisions, and stipulations of the treaty of Payne's Landing, made with the Seminoles on the ninth day of May, A.</p>

<p>D., one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, as a constituent part of that tribe, and re-unite with that tribe in their abode west, in which case the United States would pay six thousand dollars for the reservations in that case relinquished by the first article of the said two treaties.</p>

<p>That in the hostilities that afterwards took place between the Creeks and Seminoles and the United States, the said Apalachicola Band remained loyal to the United States, and maintained their peace and friendship unbroken; but, in the year 1837, they were induced by the urgent solicitation of the emigrating agent of the United States, to remove from the country occupied by them in Florida, to the Indian country west of Arkansas, leaving the lands so granted them as aforesaid, and a large number of horses, mules, cattle, hogs, wagons, and other articles which they could not collect together and carry with them, and which the said emigrating agent persuaded them to leave in his charge, on his promise that the owners should be paid the value of all such their property, in money, by the agent of the United States, on their arrival in the country provided for them on the west side of the Mississippi; a schedule of all of which property so abandoned, and of its value, and of the improvements on lands abandoned by them, and the value of each, is annexed to this article, and forms a part of it.</p>

<p>That, by the treaty of Payne's Landing, made on the ninth day of May, A. D., one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, the United States agreed to pay the Seminole Indians, in full compensation for all their claim to lands in the Territory of Florida, and for all improvements on the lands so ceded, the sum of fifteen thousand four hundred dollars, to be divided among the chiefs and warriors of the several towns in a ratio proportioned to their population; and they further agreed to take the cattle belonging to the Seminoles, at the valuation of some person to be appointed by the President, and to pay the valuation, in money, to the respective owners, or give them other cattle; and the expenses of removal were to be paid by the United States, and subsistence for twelve months, to all <!-- <font color="red"> -->emigants<!-- </font> -->, furnished by them;</p>

<p>And that no compensation has ever been made any of the said Apalachicola Band. for the lands or improvements so abandoned by them, or for the horses, mules, cattle and other property abandoned by them; nor have they ever received any part of the annuities paid the Seminole or Creek Nation since their removal west, or been recognized as an integral part of the Seminole Nation, as it was provided they should be;</p>

<p>And, inasmuch as the forced emigration of the said band, and their surrender and abandonment of their lands, improvements, horses, cattle and other property in consequence thereof, was equivalent, as against the United States, to an election, by them, to surrender the rights, privileges secured by the treaties of the 18th June, 1833, and to claim the rights and privileges thereby vesting in them, as parties to the treaty of Payne's Landing, of the 9th of May, 1832;</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>C. S., upon restoration of peace to investigate and pay certain claims of Apalachicola Indians.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>Therefore, it is hereby agreed by the Confederate States of America, by Albert Pike, its Commissioner, with full powers, with the members and survivors of the Apalachicola Band of Florida Indians, that upon and after the restoration of peace, the said claims of the members of that Band, to compensation for the loss of the lands, improvements, horses, cattle, mules and other property, shall be fairly investigated, in a generous and liberal spirit, by an officer or commissioners, to whom that duty shall be assigned by the Confederate States; and that whatever shall appear, upon such investigation, to be justly or equitable owing to members of the said band, on account of such losses as aforesaid, shall be paid to the persons originally entitled to the same, or to the legal representatives of such of them as may be deceased.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>Also, claims of Black Dirt's Band of Seminoles.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>And it is also further agreed, that the foregoing provisions of this article shall extend to, and include the claims for losses of the same kind, by members of Black Dirt's Band of friendly Seminoles, who lost property in like manner, in consequence of their hurried removal west, as the same is contained in the schedule thereof, marked B, annexed to this article.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>Also, claims to money in lieu of land warrants.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>And it is also agreed that the claims to money, in lieu of bounty land warrants, of the persons whose names and those of their heirs are contained in the schedule marked C, annexed to this article, shall in like manner, and at the same period, be investigated, and so far as they shall be found to be well founded, shall be paid by the Confederate States.</p>

<p>ARTICLE. It being well known to all surrounding tribes and universally acknowledged, that, from time immemorial, the Ta-wa-i-hash people of Indians, now called, by white men, the Wich-i-tas, and of whom the Hue-cos and Ta-hua-ca-ros are offshoots, possessed and inhabited, to the exclusion of all other tribes and bands of Indians, the whole country lying between the Red river and the False Washita, from their junction to the west of the Wich-i-ta mountains, and with the aid of the Ta-nei-weh Band of the Ne-um, held all that country against all comers, and had their villages and fields in the <!-- <font color="red"> -->vallies<!-- </font> --> of the Wich-i-ta mountains and upon the creeks, and there cultivated the soil, raised stock and led an industrious life; all which facts were known to the Commissioner of the Confederate States twenty-nine years ago.</p>

<p>And the United States of America, having, in the year eighteen hundred and twenty, and by subsequent renewals of the grant, ceded, the whole of that country to the Choctaws; and having afterwards, by patent, conveyed and assured the same to them in fee, and they having made the Chickasaws joint and equal owners of the same with themselves; whereby the same has been wholly lost to the Ta-wa-i-hash, except such small portion thereof as has been assigned to them by way of <!-- <font color="red"> -->reservc<!-- </font> -->; and no compensation whatever has been made them therefor, although they respectfully presented their claim on account of the same to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs of the United States, and appealed to that Government for payment of some reasonable price for their said country, to be paid them in such manner as should be most for their benefit and improvement;</p>

<milestone unit="section" rend="hr"/><pb xml:id="p353" n="353" />

<p>And the Commissioner knowing that their claim to compensation is a just one, and seeing how poor and helpless they are, and being willing to save them from the necessity of employing persons to urge their claim, and of dividing with them what they may receive, but not deeming himself authorized to decide what amount shall be allowed them therefor, nor in what manner it shall be paid.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>Claim of the Wich-i-tas to compensation for their country between the Red river and False Washita to be determined by the President.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>It is, therefore, hereby agreed by the Confederate States, that the claim of the Ta-wa-i-hash or Wich-i-tas to compensation for their country, between the Red river and the False Washita, shall be submitted to the President for his consideration, who, if he also agrees that it is just, shall determine what amount shall be paid or allowed them in satisfaction thereof, and in what manner that amount shall be paid; and that amount shall accordingly be paid them in such manner as he shall direct.</p>

And the Confederate States will not permit improper persons to live among them, but only such persons as are employed by the Confederate States and traders licensed by them, who shall sell to the Indians and buy from them at fair prices, under such regulations as the President shall make.</p>

And the Confederate States agree that if any prisoners are so brought in and restored, suitable rewards shall be given the band that brings them in, for doing so. But this article creates no obligation to deliver up Mexicans who may be prisoners.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>The C. S. ask nothing of the Comanches except that they will settle upon their reserves, live peaceably, &amp; c., and agree to furnish them with rations, stocks, agricultural implements, &amp;c.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>ARTICLE XV. The Confederate States ask nothing of the bands of the Ne-um, except that they will settle upon their reserves, become industrious, prepare to support themselves, and live in peace and quietness; and in order to encourage and assist them in their endeavors to become able to support themselves, the Confederate States agree to furnish them rations of provisions in the same manner as they are now doing for the Wichitas and other tribes and bands settled upon reserves, to include also sugar and coffee, salt, soap and vinegar, for such time as may be necessary to enable them to feed themselves. They agree to furnish each of the said bands of the Ne-um with twenty cows and calves for every fifty persons contained in the same, and one bull for every forty cows and calves; and also other stock at the discretion of the superintendent when they desire to have the same; all of which animals shall be distributed by the agent to such persons and families as shall, in his judgment, be most likely to take care of them. And they also agree to furnish for the use of the said bands of the Ne-um, such number of draught oxen, wagons, carts, ploughs, shovels, hoes, pick-axes, spades, scythes, rakes, axes and seeds as may be necessary to enable them to farm successfully. They also agree to furnish the said bands of the Ne-um, annually, with such quantities as the agent shall estimate for, and the superintendent require, of all such articles as are mentioned and contained in schedule hereunto annexed, marked A, to be issued and delivered to them by the agent.</p>

The Confederate States will employ and pay one interpreter for all the bands of the Ne-um settled upon the reserves; and an additional blacksmith, another striker, and another wagon-maker, shall be employed for the bands of the Neum alone, when the said four bands of the Neum shall have come in and settle upon reserves. The interpreter, blacksmith, striker and wagon-maker shall reside with some one of the bands. The Confederate States will also furnish, from time to time, such tools and such supplies of iron, steel and wood as may be needed for the work of the said bands; and will also furnish them with medicines and medical advice, at the agency, where a physician shall be employed to reside, for their benefit exclusively. And they will also employ, for five years and as much longer as the President shall please, a farmer for each reserve, to instruct them in cultivating the soil, so that they may soon be able to feed themselves; and will erect such a number of horse-mills, to grind their corn, as the superintendent shall consider to be necessary, in order to accommodate all.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVIII. The Confederate States also agree to erect such buildings for the mills, and the blacksmith shops, and houses for the farmers, interpreters and physicians as have been erected among the other Indian tribes, and also to assist the said Indians in building houses for themselves, and in digging wells for water, and opening their lands.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIX. The said four bands agree to remain upon their reserves, when they shall have settled thereon, and not, at any time, to leave them in order to make crops elsewhere. And, if they should leave them, the Confederate States shall not be bound any longer to feed them or make them presents, or give them any assistance.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>Rifle and ammunition to be furnished each warrior.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>ARTICLE XX. The Confederate States also agree to furnish each warrior of the said four bands, who has not a gun, with a flint-lock rifle and ammunition, which he agrees never to sell or give away, and the Confederate States will punish any trader or other white man who may purchase one from them.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIII. The Seminoles having asked the Confederate States to pay them for certain horses stolen from them by some of the Ne-um, two years ago, and which the United States were bound to pay for if they could not be recovered, the Confederate States have accordingly agreed to do so, at the time of making the treaty lately with the Seminoles; and they do hereby agree, in order that the Neum may not hereafter be troubled about the horses so taken, to pay for them the sums, and to the persons, mentioned in the schedule thereof hereunto annexed; but as the Seminoles allege that one or more of their horses is now here in the possession of some of the No-co-ni, Ta-ne-i-weh, Ya-pa-rih-ca or Co-cho-tih-ca band of Ne-um, it is agreed that, if it be so, such horse or horses shall be given up, and the person in possession shall be compensated for the loss of the same. To this end, the Chiefs will let the Seminoles see all their horses; and, after this time, it is distinctly understood that no one can get any right to property by stealing it, and that no compensation will ever again be made to any one who has given up stolen property. And the Confederate States do hereby agree with the several persons from whom horses were stolen, and the heirs of such of them as are deceased, and whose names are found in the said schedule B, hereunto annexed, that they will pay, immediately upon the ratification of this treaty, through the agent for the Seminoles, the amount of loss sustained by each respectively, according to the said schedule, except for such horses as may be returned as above provided for and noted as returned on the said schedule.</p>

In order that the friendship which now exists between the said several tribes and bands of Indians, now or hereafter settled in the said leased country, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws and the people of the Confederate States, may not be interrupted by the conduct of individuals, it is hereby agreed, that if any white man or any Choctaw or Chickasaw injures an Indian of any one of said tribes and bands, or if any one them injuries a white man or a Choctaw or Chickasaw, no private revenge or retaliation shall take place, nor shall the Choctaws or Chickasaws try the person who does the wrong, and punish, him in their courts, but he shall be tried and punished by the Confederate States; and the life of every person belonging to said tribes and bands shall be of the same value as the life of a white man; and any Indian or white man who kills one of them without cause, shall be hung by the neck until he is dead.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>The stealing of property regarded as disgraceful.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>ARTICLE XIX. To steal a horse or any other article of property from a white man or an Indian not at war with the Confederate States, shall always be regarded as disgraceful, and the Chiefs  of the Osages will discountenance and prevent it by every means in their power.

But such stock and implements shall only be issued from time to time, and to such persons as shall be reported by the agent to the superintendent to be engaged or ready to engage in farming, and who will take care of and profitably use the same, and be benefitted by them, and not sell, waste or destroy the same; upon which reports, and so only, the superinten-</p>

That the said three parties, by their delegates, after the making of the said treaty, of the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-six, borrowed from Corcoran and Riggs, bankers in the city of Washington, the sum of sixty thousand dollars, upon agreement endorsed by the Secretary of War, by which the same was to be repaid, with interest, when the moneys payable under said treaty should be appropriated, as follows, that is to say; twenty-five thousand dollars by the treaty party, twenty thousand dollars by the western Cherokees or old settler party, and fifteen thousand dollars by the Cherokee Nation. That at the session of Congress next after the making of that treaty, the sum of twenty-seven thousand dollars, for the Cherokee Nation, was appropriated under the eighth article of the same, and the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, under the sixth article, for the treaty party; but no appropriation was made for the western Cherokees or old settler party, under the fourth article, (whereunder only any moneys were payable to them,) the amount due them, and which was to be wholly paid <hi rend="italics">per capita,</hi> under that article, not having as yet been ascertained; that consequently the sum borrowed as aforesaid, with the accrued interest, was repaid out of the
 two appropriations aforesaid, one half of the principal and interest which should have been paid by the western Cherokee or old settler party, being deducted from and paid out of the appropriation made for each of the others; and there being thus paid, out of the moneys so appropriated under</p>


<milestone unit="section" rend="hr"/><pb xml:id="p409" n="409" />

<p>the eighth article, for various purposes, for the whole nation, over and above its proportion, the sum of ten thousand three hundred dollars; and out of the moneys appropriated under the sixth article, for those of the treaty party who had sustained losses and damage in consequence of the treaty of the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, over and above the proportion of that party, a like sum of ten thousand three hundred dollars. That when afterwards the amount ascertained to be due to the western Cherokees or old settlers, under the fourth article, was appropriated, the whole amount was paid to and distributed among them <hi rend="italics">per capita,</hi> and no part of the sum so advanced for them, out of the other and previous appropriations, was reserved, nor has any part thereof whatever hitherto been re-imbursed to those entitled to receive the same, by the western Cherokees, or by the United States, or otherwise howsoever.</p>

<!-- <p><font color="red" size="-1"><p>Payments agreed to be made by the C. S. to be distributed among the claimants of the treaty party.</p></font><lb/> -->

<p>Therefore, it is further hereby agreed that the Confederate States will pay, upon the ratification of this treaty, to the Cherokee Nation, the sum of ten thousand three hundred dollars; and will also appropriate and place in the hands of the agent for the Cherokees the further sum of ten thousand three hundred dollars, to be distributed among the claimants of the treaty party, provided for by the sixth article of the said treaty, or their legal representatives under the laws of the nation, in such proportions as it shall be certified to him by Stand Watie, the only surviving member of the committee of five, appointed under that article to audit such claims, that it ought, in accordance with the allowances made by the committee, to be distributed among them.</p>

<p>And it was agreed by the said eighth article of the said treaty of the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-six, that of the sum of twenty-seven thousanddollars, provided thereby to be paid to the Cherokee Nation, the sum of five thousand dollars should be equally divided among all those whose arms were taken from them previous to their removal west, by order of an officer of the United States, and of that sum of five thousand dollars, three thousand three hundred dollars was applied to the payment in part of the proportion of the money borrowed as aforesaid, due by the Western Cherokees or Old Settler party; and as the authorities of the nation declined to receive the residue of said sum of five thousand dollars, it being but one thousand seven hundred dollars, and that residue never was paid by the United States, and still remains due by them,--</p>

<p>Therefore, it is hereby further agreed, that the Confederate States will also pay, upon the ratification of this treaty, to the treasurer of the Cherokee Nation, the further sum of one thousand seven hundred dollars; making, with the said sum of ten thousand three hundred dollars, the sum of twelve thousand dollars; and that out of the same, the sum of five thousand dollars shall, by the authorities of the nation, be distributed among those persons, and their legal representatives, whose arms were taken from them as aforesaid: and that any part of that sum finally remaining undistributed, together with the residue of seven thousand dollars, shall be used and appropriated in such manner as the national council shall direct.</p>
