<p> <hi rend="italics">Honourable  Gentlemen,  <orig reg="Commissioners">Commi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ioners</orig> for the

<p><orig reg="At">A<hi rend="smallCaps">T</hi></orig> a Treaty, held by me two Years ago,
in Behalf of the Government of <orig reg="Pennsylvania"><hi rend="italics">Penn<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ylvania</hi></orig>, with a Number of the Chiefs of the
<hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">Six

to the Governor of <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> concerning <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig> Lands in the back Parts of that Province,
which they claim a Right to from their <orig reg="Conquests">Conque<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ts</orig> over the  ancient  <orig reg="Possessors">Po<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ors</orig>, and which have
been <orig reg="settled"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ettled</orig> by <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig> of the Inhabitants of that Government,
without their <orig reg="Consent">Con<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ent</orig>, or any <orig reg="Purchase">Purcha<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> made from them. It was at that time <orig reg="understood">under<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tood</orig> that the Claim was upon <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> only;  but it has <orig reg="since"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ince</orig> appeared, by <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig>
Letters formerly wrote by Mr. <orig reg="President">Pre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ident </orig> <hi rend="italics">Logan</hi> to the late Governor of <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi>, that
it related <orig reg="likewise">likewi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> to <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig> Lands in the back Parts of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi>.

that for that End a Time and Place might be fixed for a Treaty with
them; but before this could be effected, an unfortunate <orig reg="Skirmish">Skir-</orig>

<pb n="45"/>

mi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>h happened in the back Parts of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi>,
between fome of the Militia there, and a Party of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Warriors of the <hi rend="italics">Six
Nations</hi>, with <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome </orig> <orig reg="Loss">Lo<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>s</orig> on both Sides. Who were the <orig reg="Aggressors">Aggre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ors</orig> is not at this
time to be <orig reg="discussed">di<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>cu<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ed</orig>, both Parties
having agreed to bury that Affair in Oblivion, and the Government of
<hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> having, in Token of the Continuance
of their <orig reg="Friendship">Friend<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hip</orig>, presented the <hi rend="italics">Six Nations</hi>, through my Hands, with Goods to the
Value of One Hundred Pounds Sterling. To prevent further <orig reg="Hostilities">Ho<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tilities</orig>, and to heal this Breach, I had, before
the <orig reg="Present">Pre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ent</orig> was given, made a Tender of my
good Offices; which both Parties accepted, and <orig reg="consented">con<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ented</orig>, on my <orig reg="Instances">In<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tances</orig>,
to lay down their Arms: Since which the Faith pledged to me has been
mutually <orig reg="preserved">pre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>erved</orig>, and a Time and Place has
been agreed upon, through my Intervention, for accommodating all
Differences, and for <orig reg="settling"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ettling</orig> a firm Peace,
Union and <orig reg="Friendship">Friend<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hip</orig>, as well between the
Government of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> as that of <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi>, and the <hi rend="italics">Indians

Nations</hi>, are now met at the Place appointed for the Treaty. It
only remains therefore for me to <orig reg="say"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ay</orig>, That
if my further good Offices <orig reg="shall"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hall</orig> be thought
<orig reg="useful">u<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>eful</orig> for the <orig reg="Accomplishment">Accompli<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hment</orig> of this Work, you may rely <orig reg="most">mo<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>t </orig> <orig reg="assuredly">a<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>uredly</orig> upon them. <lb/><lb/> </p>

<p><orig reg="But">B<hi rend="smallCaps">UT</hi></orig> I hope, honourable Gentlemen
<orig reg="Commissioners">Commi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ioners</orig>, it
will not be taken <orig reg="amiss">ami<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>s</orig> if I go a little
further, and briefly <orig reg="represent">repre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ent</orig> to you, how
<orig reg="especially">e<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>pecially </orig> <orig reg="necessary">nece<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ary</orig> it is at this
Juncture, for his <orig reg="Majesty's">Maje<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ty's</orig> Service, and the
Good of all his Colonies in this Part of his Dominions, that Peace
and <orig reg="Friendship">Friend<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hip</orig> is  <orig reg="established">e<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tabli<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hed</orig> between your
Governments and the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">Six Nations</hi>. <lb/><lb/> </p>

<p><orig reg="These">T<hi rend="smallCaps">HESE</hi></orig> <hi rend="italics"> Indians</hi>,
by their Situation, are a Frontier to <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig>
of them; and, from thence, if Friends, are capable of defending their
Settlements; if Enemies, of making cruel Ravages upon them; if
Neuters, they may deny the French a <orig reg="Passage">Pa<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>age</orig> through their Country, and give us timely
Notice of their <orig reg="Designs">De<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>igns</orig>. <orig reg="These">The<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> are but <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig> of the
Motives for cultivating  a  good  <orig reg="Under-standing">Under<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tanding</orig> with them; but from hence the <orig reg="Disadvantages">Di<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>advantages</orig> of a Rupture are abundantly evident.
Every Advantage you gain over them in War will be a weakening of the
Barrier of <orig reg="those">tho<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> Colonies, and <orig reg="consequently">con<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>equently</orig>
be, in effect, Victories over <orig reg="yourselves">your<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>elves</orig> and
your Fellow Subjects. Some Allowances for their Prejudices and <orig reg="Passions">Pa<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ions</orig>, and a <orig reg="Present">Pre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ent</orig> now and then for the Relief of their
<orig reg="Necessities">Nece<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ities</orig>, which
have, in  <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome </orig> <orig reg="Measure">Mea<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ure</orig>, been brought upon them by their
<orig reg="Intercourse">Intercour<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> with us, and by our yearly
extending our Settlements, will probably tie them more <orig reg="closely">clo<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ely</orig>  to the Britifh <orig reg="Interest">Intere<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>t</orig>. This has been the Method of New-York and

<orig reg="desired">de<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ired</orig>  to  make  as <orig reg="strong"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>trong</orig> a League, and to be upon as good Terms
with us as the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> were, with whom he was
united, and to become one People with us: And by his further Care in
looking into what had paired between us, he found that the Rope which
tied the Ship to the great Mountain was only <orig reg="fastened">fa<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tened</orig> with Wampum, which was liable to break and
rot, and to <orig reg="perish">peri<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>h</orig> in a <orig reg="Course">Cour<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> of Years; he therefore told us, he would give

<p><orig reg="We">W<hi rend="smallCaps">E </hi></orig> <orig reg="must">mu<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>t</orig> now
tell you what Mountains we mean that we <orig reg="say"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ay</orig>
are the Boundaries between you and us. You may remember, that about
twenty Years ago you had a Treaty with us at <hi rend="italics">Albany</hi>, when you took a Belt of Wampum, and made
a Fence with it on the Middle of the Hill, and told us, that if any
of the Warriors of the <hi rend="italics">Six Nations</hi> came on
your Side of the Middle of the Hill, you would hang them; and you
gave us Liberty to do the <orig reg="same"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ame</orig> with any of
your People who should be found on our Side of the Middle of the
Hill. This is the Hill we mean, and we <orig reg="desire">de<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ire</orig> that Treaty may be now confirmed. After we
left <hi rend="italics">Albany</hi>, we brought our Road a great deal
more to the <orig reg="West">We<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>t</orig>, that we might comply with
your <orig reg="Proposal">Propo<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>al</orig>; but, tho' it was of your own
making, your People never <orig reg="observed">ob<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>erved</orig> it, but
came and lived on our Side of the Hill, which we don't blame you for,
as you live at a great <orig reg="Distance">Di<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tance</orig>, near the
Seas, and cannot be thought to know what your People do in the Back-parts: And on their <orig reg="settling"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ettling</orig>, contrary to
your own <orig reg="Proposal">Propo<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>al</orig>, on our new Road, it fell

<pb n="57"/>

is <orig reg="impossible">impo<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ible</orig> for

<p><hi rend="italics">Brethren</hi>, <lb/> </p>

<p>I <orig reg="considered">con<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>idered</orig> this Matter well before I
came from <hi rend="italics">Philadelphia</hi>, and I <orig reg="advised">advi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ed</orig> with the Council there upon it, as I have
done here with the honourable the <orig reg="Commissioners">Commi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ioners</orig> of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi>. I never heard before of the Murder
of the three <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> at <hi rend="italics">Ohio</hi>; had Complaint been made to me of it, and it
had appeared to have been committed by any of the People under my
Government, they <orig reg="should"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hould</orig> have been put to
Death, as two of them were, <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig> Years ago,
for killing two <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>. You are not to take
your own Satisfaction, but to apply to me, and I will <orig reg="see"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ee</orig> that <orig reg="justice">ju<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tice</orig> be done
you; and <orig reg="should"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hould</orig> any of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> rob or murder any of our People, I do
expect that you will deliver them up to be tried and <orig reg="punished">puni<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hed</orig> in the <orig reg="same"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ame</orig> Manner
as white People are. This is the Way to <orig reg="preserve">pre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>erve </orig> <orig reg="Friendship">Friend<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hip</orig> between
us, and will be for your Benefit as well as ours. I am well <orig reg="pleased">plea<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ed</orig> with the Steps you have already taken, and
the Reproofs you have given to your <orig reg="Cousins">Cou<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ins</orig>
the <hi rend="italics">Delawares</hi>;, and do expect you will lay
your Commands upon <orig reg="some"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ome</orig> of their Chiefs to
bring down the two young Men that were <orig reg="present">pre<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ent</orig> at the Murders; if they are not brought
down, I <orig reg="shall"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hall</orig> look upon it as a Proof of
their Guilt. <lb/><lb/> </p>

<p><orig reg="If">I<hi rend="smallCaps">F</hi></orig>, upon Examination, they <orig reg="shall"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hall</orig> be found not to have been concerned in the
bloody Action, they <orig reg="shall"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>hall</orig> be well <orig reg="used">u<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ed</orig>, and <orig reg="sent"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ent</orig> home in
Safety: I will take it upon <orig reg="myself">my<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>elf</orig> to <orig reg="see"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ee</orig> that  they  have  no  <orig reg="Injustice">Inju<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tice</orig> done them. An Inventory is taken of the
Goods already <orig reg="restored">re<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>tored</orig>, and I expect
Satisfaction will be made for <orig reg="such"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>uch</orig> as cannot
be found, in Skins, according to their <orig reg="Promise">Promi<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig>. <lb/><lb/> </p>

<p>I well remember the coming down of one of the <hi rend="italics">Conoy Indians</hi> with a  Paper,  <orig reg="setting"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>etting</orig> forth, That the <hi rend="italics">Conoys</hi> had come to a <orig reg="Resolution">Re<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>olution</orig> to leave the
Land <orig reg="reserved">re<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>erved</orig> for them by the Proprietors,
but he made no Complaint to me of ill <orig reg="Usage">U<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>age</orig>
from the white People. The <orig reg="Reason">Rea<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>on</orig> he gave
for their Removal was, That the <orig reg="settling"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>ettling</orig> of
the white People all round them had made Deer <orig reg="scarce"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>carce</orig>, and that therefore they <orig reg="chose">cho<seg n="u383">ſ</seg>e</orig> to remove to <orig reg="Junsiata">Jun<hi rend="italics"/>iata</orig>
for the Benefit

of Hunting. I ordered what they <orig reg="said"><seg n="u383">ſ</seg>aid</orig> to be
entered in the Council-Book. The old Man's Expences were born, and a
