gave the name of "Cumberland" to the lofty range of mountains to  the
west, and passed a remarkable  depression  in  the  chain,  which  he

<p>I take you by the hand and heartily bid you all wellcome to  this
place where I have kindled a Council Fire for affairs of  importance.
The  <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi  rend="super">r</hi></orig>  of  New  Jersey  and  the   <orig reg="Commissioners">Comm<hi rend="super">rs</hi></orig>  of  Virginia  &amp;  Pensilvania  do   likewise welcome    you    here.    <orig reg="Lieutenant">Lieut<hi    rend="super">t </hi></orig>  <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi rend="super">r </hi></orig> Penn came hither  to  meet  you  &amp;  waited  a
considerable time, but was at length by business  obliged  to  return
home, leaving these  Gentlemen  as  <orig reg="Commissioners">Comm<hi  rend="super">rs</hi></orig>  on behalf of Pensylvania<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Both  the  <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi  rend="super">r</hi></orig>  &amp;  Gentlemen  <orig reg="Commissioners">Comm<hi rend="super">rs</hi></orig> as well as myself, having waited here a month to no purpose began to be impatient never the less you  see  that  their desire to meet you  prevailed  over  every  other  consideration  and induced them to stay. I hope therefore that you are  now  come  fully prepared and with Hearts well inclined  to  the  great  business  for
which we are convened, and in order to prepare  you  the  better  for
these purposes, I do now, agreeable to the antient custom  establishd
by our Forefathers, proceed to the ceremony of  Condolence  usual  on
these occasions<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>And first: With this String of Wamp:  I  do,  on  behalf  of  His
Majesty &amp; all His subjects wipe away the  Tears  from  your  eyes
which you are constantly shedding for your late deceased Cheifs,  and
I clear your sight that so you may look cheerfully at your Bretheren,
who are come from Several of the Provinces  to  attend  this  General
Congress ordered by His Majesty to be held by me; in order to  settle
some necessary points between him &amp; you<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>With this String I clear the Passage to your Hearts that you  may
speak cheerfully and candidly on the several subjects  which,  during
this Congress, will be treated of, as well as to  remove  all  sorrow
&amp; uneasiness from you<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>With this last string I wipe away the blood of your friends  from
off your Births, that you may on your  return  rest  with  Peace  and
comfort on them	Gave the 3 Strings<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Bretheren<lb/></p>

<p>I am greatly concerned for the many losses you have sustained  in
your several Nations since our last meeting &amp;  sincerely  condole
with you for them all	1. A Belt. </p>

<p>Brethren<lb/></p>

<p>With this Belt I light up, anew your several Council Fires,  that
the Cheifs still remaining may upon all occasions sit comfortably  by
them and consult on the several matters, which may come before  them.
2. A Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>As I have by the former Belt  kindled  up  your  several  Council
Fires, I do now by this Belt desire, that you  the  Councillors  will
duly assemble, when the affairs of your  nations  require  it,  &amp;
then jealously apply yourselves to every measure which  may  tend  to
your Peace and Interest.	A Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren.<lb/></p>

<p>With this Belt I dispel the darkness which  for  some  time  past
hath overspread your several Countries, by reason of your many  &amp;
great Losses, and now heartily wish you may enjoy a 

<pb n="115" />

serene clear sky, so that you may be able to see your Brethren from the  Sun
rising to the Sun setting	4 A. Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren, <lb/></p>

<p>As I would deal with all people in their own way, and  that  your
Ancestors have from the earliest time directed  and  recommended  the
observation of a Sett of Rules  which  they  laid  down  for  you  to
follow, I do now, agreeable to that  custom,  take  of  the  clearest
water and therewith cleanse your inside  from  all  Filth  and  every
thing which has given you concern. 5 A Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>I must  desire  that  you  Sachems  &amp;  Councillors  will,  as
occasions may require consult with the Cheiftains of your young  men,
as they  are  in  general  men  of  sense  and  experience;  and  you
cheiftains and Warriors to pay a  due  regard  to  your  Sachems  and
Councillors whose sage advice will seldom  or  never  be  amiss  6  A
Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>In performing these ceremonies I  can  not  omit  this  necessary
part, which is, that as there are but  two  Council  Fires  for  your
confederacy, the one at my house and the other at  Onondaga,  I  must
desire that you will always be ready to attend either of  them,  when
called upon, by which means business will I hope, always be  attended
&amp; properly carried  on  for  our  mutual  Interest,  and  this  I
earnestly recommend to you all	7 A Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>I must also advise you to be unanimous amongst  yourselves  &amp;
reside in your respective Countries, and not think of  scattering  or
settling amongst other Nations, as has been too much the Practice for
some years past, to the great weakening  of  your  confederacy.  8  A
Belt<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>I give you a Pouch with a String of Wampum in it, which  you  are
to make use of when you here of the loss of any of  the  Confederacy,
and rise up on such occasions without delay in order to  condole  for
the same, and remove the concern  thereby  occasioned  3  Strings  of
Wampum<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>I now supply you with a torch or candle which you  are  to  travel
with by night upon any extraordinary emergency, such as the  approach
of an enemy, in  order  to  communicate  the  News  with  the  utmost
despatch.	3 Strings <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>The Nations gave the Yo-hah at the proper places, and the ceremony
of Condolence. Adjourned till next day. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Canaghquieson, Chief of Oneida,  stood  up  &amp;  addressing  all

his own name upon him, on which his Excellency

<pb n="116" />

<orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> Franklin  shook  him  by  the  hand  &amp; returned him thanks.  Then  Canaghquieson  proceeded  to  answer  the

<p>We congratulate you, the <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> and  the  rest of the Gentlemen on your safe arrival at this  Place,  where  we  are
heartily glad to meet you. Then after repeating what Sir William  had
said on the first strings, yesterday, he  said,  they  did  on  their
parts wipe away the Tears  which  their  Brothers  the  English  were
shedding for their losses as also the blood  of  their  friends  from
their seats, cleansing their hearts that they may be able  to  attend
the important affairs which were  to  be  transacted	Gave  3  Strings
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Then repeated all that Sir William had said on  the  Black  Belts
given at the Condolence for all which he  returned  thanks  and  said
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are much concerned at the losses you have met  with  since  our

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We all express our thanks  to  you  for  the  remembrance  of  our

young men as occasion may require,  and  your  directions  that  they
should on their parts pay due regard to  us,  and  we  shall  observe
whatever you have recommended to us	A Belt <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are sensible that we have but two great Council Fires, the  one
at your house, the other at Onondaga, We shall  always  be  ready  to
attend at either for the public Good,  and  we  hope  that  you  will
continue to be ready to meet us often as the general  Peace  requires
it A Belt <lb/></p>

<p>Brother, <lb/></p>

<p>We give you thanks for recommending unanimity to us. We know  that
our living together is necessary to our happiness and that  it  gives
us strength We will follow your advice, and we recommend  it  to  the
English to be unanimous in all good works	A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are happy to find you so observant of our ancient Customs, that
you give us a string in a Pouch to make use of when we have  occasion
to communicate our losses and condole for them. We request  you  will
be equally observant of these matters,  that  so  our  Grief  may  be
timely and properly removed	A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We also give you many thanks for supplying  us  with  a  Torch  to
travel with on emergencys. We assure that we shall make proper use of
it, &amp; communicate every necessary intelligence to  you.  All  the
six  Nations,  with  the  Shawanese,  Delawares,  &amp;   all   their
dependants as far as to the great Plains of Sioto,  give  you  thanks
for your good words which were  a  cordial  to  them,  and  they  all
request that you will continue in the same good sentiments.	3 Strings

which depends on the friendship subsisting between us  &amp;  a  free

<p>Brethren <lb/></p>

<p>Hearken to me who have good words to speak to you, such as are for
the benefit of your  whole  confederacy  and  of  your  children  yet
unborn. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>You all remember that three years ago I signified to you His Matys
desire to establish a Boundary Line between his people and yours  and
that we then agreed together how some part of that Line  should  run,
whenever, the same came to be settled <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>You all, I am hopefull, recollect the Reasons I then gave you  for
making such a Boundary never the less I shall again repeat them.  You
know Brethren that the encroachments upon your Lands have been always
one of your principal subjects of complaint, and that so  far  as  it
could be done endeavors have not  been  wanting  for  your  obtaining
Redress. But it was a difficult Task, and generally unsuccessfull &#8212; for
altho' the Provinces have bounds between each  other,  there  are  no
certain Bounds between them &amp; you, And thereby not  only  several
of our people ignorant in Indian Affairs have advanced too  far  into
your country, but also many of your own people through  the  want  of
such a Line have been deceived in the Sales they have made or in  the
limits they have set to our respective claims This,  Brethren,  is  a
sad Case, which has frequently given us much trouble, and turned many
of your heads; but it is likely to continue so untill some Bounds are
agreed to, fixed upon and made public between us. The Great the  good
King of England my master, whose friendship  and  tender  regard  for
your Interests I wish you may ever hold in  remembrance  has  amongst
other Instances of his Goodness after long deliberation on some means
for your releif, and for preventing future disputes concerning Lands,
at length resolved upon fixing a general Boundary  Line  between  his
subjects and you, and  that  in  such  a  manner  as  shall  be  most
agreeable to you, in consequence of which I have received  his  Royal
commands to call you together  for  the  establishment  thereof,  and
after conferring with the Governments interested hereupon, you

far as the English Name extends &#8212; His Majesty has directed me to give
you   a   handsome   proof   of    his    Generosity    <orig reg="proportioned">proportion<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> to the nature and extent of what Lands  shall  fall to him &#8212; Upon the whole  I  hope  that  your  deliberations  will  be unanimous &amp; your Resolutions such as His  Maty  may  consider  as proofs of your gratitude for  all  his  favors  &#8212;	A  fine  New  Belt.<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>The Importance of this affair now before  us  requires  the  most
serious attention. I will not burthen  you  with  any  other  subject
untill this is generally settled, and  therefore  we  shall  adjourn,
that you may have time to think of it and come fully prepared to give
an agreeable answer <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Then Abraham Cheif of the Mohawks after repeating what Sir William
had said addressed him <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We give you thanks for what you have said to us at this  time,  it
is a weighty affair, and we shall agreeable to your  desire  take  it
into our most serious consideration <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>We are glad that so many great men are assembled to  bear  witness
of the transaction and we are now resolved to retire and consult on a
proper answer to be given to all you have said, &amp; so soon  as  we
have agreed upon it, we shall give  you  notice  that  we  may  again
assemble, and make it known to you and we are all much obliged to you
that you have directed us to attend to this  great  affair  alone  at
this time that our minds might not be burthened or diverted  from  it
by attending to anything else. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Then Conoghquieson  addressed  the  whole  and  desired  that  the
several Nations might look towards the Onondagas  who  would  appoint
him a time  and  place  for  taking  the  matter  into  consideration
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>P M. Sir  William  met  the  Nanticokes  with  Captain  Ogden  and
explained to them the affair of the Sale of their Lands of which  the
approved, as well as of the price which [is] 666  Dollars  &amp;  two

and consider of the Great  affair  before  them  with  pleasure,  and
assured him that they would endeavour to do every thing for the best,
and that with the utmost expedition &#8212; They told Sir William that they

</p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We  have  been  for  some  time  deliberating  on  what  you  said
concerning a Line between the English and us, &amp; we  are  sensible
it would be for our mutual advantage if it were not transgressed, but
dayly experience teaches us that we cannot have any great  dependance
on the white People, and that they will forget their  agreements  for
the sake of our Lands &#8212; However you have said so much to us  upon  it
that  we  are  willing  to  beleive  more  favorably  in  this  case.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>You remember when we spoke last concerning this Boundary, that  we
did not agree about the way it should run from Oswegy<ref target="n120.01" n="1"></ref> &#8212; This is a point that must now be settled for to what purpose  could it be to draw a Line between us &amp; the country of  Virginia  &amp;
Pensylvania whilst the way to our Towns lay open We  would  therefore
know what you intend to propose as a Boundary to the  Northward  that
we take it into consideration and we shall be glad that  you  explain
it fully to  us,  that  no  mistake  may  be  made  on  either  side.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>To which Sir William answered, <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>I have attended to what you say and do admit that it is reasonable
the Line should be closed, &amp; I persuade myself that His Maty will
approve of it All these things I had in consideration before, &amp; I
recommended the Line to you generally at first according to your  own
practice as an Introduction to the rest and in order  to  render  the
whole clear &amp; plain to you, I have prepared a Map  on  which  the
Country is drawn large &amp; plain which will enable us both to judge
better of these matters. I would therefore recommend  it  to  you  to
send the cheifs of each Nation to my Quarters where I shall  lay  the
Map before them &amp; confer with them upon it <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>The Speaker then thanked Sir William for what he  had  said  which
they all greatly approved of, in consequence of which the  Cheifs  of
each Nation came soon after to his Quarters when Sir William  laid  a
Map on the Table &amp; after explaining to them  the  nature  of  his
orders &amp; the desires of Government he spoke as follows <lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>Here is the Map of which I spoke to you, where  all  that  Country
which is the subject of our meeting is faithfully laid down. The Line
here described between the Kanhawa River &amp; Oswegy1  was  what  we
spoke about &#8212; The King has not fixed upon any particular place to

<note id="n120.01" n="1"><hi  rend="italics">Sic</hi>.  Owegy.  &#8212; E<hi rend="smallCaps">D</hi></note>

<pb n="121" />

continue it to It therefore remains for me to obtain  a  continuation
of that Line which will be secure to you and advantageous  to  us  on
which subject we now meet &#8212; I have likewise to observe  to  you  that
the piece of Land in the Forks of Susquehanna is very much desired by
the Commissioners from Pensylvania and would be more advantageous  to
them than to you, besides as it is or will be soon partly  surrounded
by Settlements it will be a very difficult matter to get  any  people
to go far to the Northward, &amp; leave such Land as it  were  behind
them &#8212; I would therefore  propose,  the  Bounds  from  Fort  Pitt  be
continued up to the Ohio to Moghulbughilum Creek,<ref target="n121.01" n="1"></ref>
Thence up that Creek &amp; along the eight mile Carrying Place<ref target="n121.02" n="2"></ref> to the West Branch of Susquehanna thence along that River to
the Allegany Ridge. Thence along  that  Ridge  of  Mountains  to  the
Cayuga Branch &amp; down  the  same  to  the  Great  East  Branch  of
Susquehanna, from thence up that East Branch to Oswegy,<ref target="n121.03" n="3"></ref> from whence it can be run Eastward to the Delaware River, which is
very near it at that Place and  for  that  part  of  this  additional
Cession which will fall to  <orig reg="Mr">M<hi  rend="super">r</hi></orig>  Penn,  you  will receive a large &amp; handsome consideration  over  and  besides  His
Matys Royal Bounty And as to the continuation of that Line  from  the
Delaware so as to close it, I must desire  to  hear  what  yourselves
think &amp; I expect that your Resolutions will  be  advantageous  to
us, &amp; that you will make proper allowance for the increase of our
People whereby you will recommend yourselves to the King, and  become
so pleasing to his subjects that it will greatly  contribute  to  the
due observance of the Boundary Line. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>To which the Speaker made the following answer <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We have hearkened to all that you have said and we thank  you  for
your advice which we beleive is well intended &#8212;  But this is  a  great
Cession of Land which will require much  thought  and  attention  and
therefore we shall  defer  the  consideration  of  it  till  tomorrow
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>Before we answer you about the continuation of the  Line  we  must
say something to you concerning the extent of  it  to  the  Southward
which we find is no further than Kanhawa River. Now Brother, you, who
know all our affairs, must  be  sensible  that  our  Rights  go  much
farther to the Southward and that we have a  very  good  &amp;  clear
Title to the Lands as far as the Cherokee  River  which  we  can  not
allow to be right of any other Indians without  doing  wrong  to  our
Posterity  and  acting  unworthy  those  Warriors  who  fought  &amp;
conquered it. We therefore expect this our Right will be  considered.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are now to speak about continuing the Line  as  you  said  from
Delaware so as to close it, and you recommend it to us  to  give  you
plenty for the people <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>We were formerly generous &amp; gave  the  white  people  in  many
places Lands when they were too poor to buy them. We have  often  had
bad Returns. Nevertheless we would still act generously and  mean  to
do as much as we can without ruining our Children <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>You know that the country from Oswegy<ref target="n122.01" n="1"></ref>
 quite  to Oswego is full of our Towns &amp; Villages and that it is  very  dear
to us so that we cannot be expected to part with  what  lies  at  our
Doors, besides your people are come  already  too  close  to  us.  We
therefore think that the Line should run up the Delaware to the Swamp
&amp; from that run across to the Governors (Cosbys Land) and then go
away to Lake  George  which  we  can  not  but  think  a  fair  offer
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>To which Sir <orig reg="William">W<hi rend="super">m</hi></orig> answered <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>We have heard what you said and shall  answer  it.  In  the  first
place I acknowledge to have heard of  your  claim  to  the  Southward
before this time The King  does  not  deny  your  claims  He  is  not
thoroughly acquainted with the exact extent of them and finding  that
they may be liable to some dispute  with  the  Southern  Indians,  he
being an enemy to strife directed the Line to be run in the manner he
thought least liable to it. But of this I shall take  further  notice
to you having no[w] to speak to you in answer to the course you  have
proposed for continuing the Line from Delaware <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>I know very well how you are situated and it is not  His  Majestys
inclination to disturb you therein,  at  the  same  time  you  should
consider what is reasonable on your parts and that the Lands are even
patented further than you propose the Line, and that the more  people
are confined the more readily will the transgress the bounds so  that
I must desire you to think the better of it and speak more  favorably
at our next meeting, till when I shall propose nothing further, as  I
could not consistently propose any other  Line  than  such  as  would
bring us to or near Lake Ontario. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>They then withdrew taking with them a Map in order to consider the
affair in private. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>At night Sir William had a private conference with the  Cheifs  of
the most Influence with whom he made use of every argument  to  bring
matters to an agreeable issue <lb/><lb/></p>

</p>

<p>The Indians continued in  Council  all  the  forenoon  the  Cheifs
having given the Belts to the Warriors for their  opinion  concerning
the Boundary; several of the Indians particularly  the  Oneidas  gave
great obstruction to the business,  and  Sir  William  heard  that  a
clergyman sent by Mr Wheelock from New England who had delivered  him
a memorial on the 14th instant "praying that the Line might  not  be
extended far North or West but the Lands reserved for the  purposes
of Religion" was very busy amongst the Indians for that purpose.<ref target="n122.02" n="2"></ref> Information was likewise given to Sir William this morning
that this Clergyman had in conversations with Coll  Fitch  Mr  Peters
junior and others told them that he had done what he could  to  opose
the Cession of Territory, and would continue to obstruct  it  to  the
utmost of his Power, and that he had shewed the Indians the folly  of
giving up their Lands &amp; cautioned them against it before he  left
Oneida <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Sir William this day cloathed several of the Cheifs with  whom  he
had several conferences the Majority of  them  continued  in  Council

to them in the  afternoon  the  Onondaga  &amp;  Mohock  Cheifs  with
several others waited on Sir William with a Message from  the  whole,
importing that as it was a very weighty &amp; interesting  affair  it
required some further consideration they therefore requested that  he
and the Gentlemen with him  would  wait  with  patience  till  monday
morning when they hoped to be able to give an answer <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Sir William told them that he was  really  become  very  impatient

their Lands depended upon their  despatch  and  the  freedom  of  the
Cession &#8212; That he would however wait till Monday, when  he  hoped  to

<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>At night several of the Cheifs came to Sir Williams  Quarters  to
let him know the purport of Intelligence and Belts received from  the
Shawanese, which was that according to the old  agreement  subsisting
between the several Indian Nations, they were all to unite and attack
the English as soon as the latter became  formidable  to  them.  That
several of the Nations to the South and West greatly alarmed  at  the
Power and increase of the English and irritated at the ill  treatment
they had met with  had  expressed  a  desire  to  meet  the  rest  to
deliberate on what was to be done. That the  Spaniards  &amp;  French
had for a long time urged  them  to  take  up  arms  and  given  them
repeated assurances of a  powerfull  assistance  That  they  had  now
called them to a meeting at the Mississippi near  the  mouth  of  the
Ohio for that purpose. That  they  had  sent  many  Belts  among  the
Indians, a great part of whom were just ready to  set  out  when  Sir
Williams message came to them, and that they waited the event of  the
Treaty at  Fort  Stanwix  before  they  would  come  to  any  further
resolution with  a  variety  of  other  particulars  all  tending  to
corroberate the former Intelligence received by Sir  William  Johnson
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>In the morning  the  Indians  again  met  in  Council,  when  the
Warriors came and laid before  their  Sachems  the  result  of  their
deliberations yesterday concerning the Northern part of the Line  who
directed  four  of  their  Sachems  viz   Tyaruruante,   Ganaquieson,
Tyeransera,<ref target="n123.01" n="1"></ref> and Tagawaron to wait on Sir  William  and communicate the same  which  was,  that  the  Line  should  run  from
Oriscany to Tianderhah,<ref target="n123.02" n="2"></ref> and down  that  River  to  the Susquehanna, thence in a straight Line to the Hills, and  so  to  the
Delaware Branch &amp; down the same to Oswegy,<ref target="n123.03" n="3"></ref>
 thence down the Susquehanna to Shamokin, and so along  the  West  Branch  of
that River to Kittanning declaring they would not part with any Lands
to the Westward of Oriscany or down  towards  Wioming  or  the  Great
Island,  as  they  reserved  that  part  of  the  Country  for  their
Dependants. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>But Sir William finding that some busy persons had  been  alarming
those Nations most immediately affected by the Line,  and  that  many
others could be induced to settle it more advantageously he in a long
and warm speech to the Cheifs shewed  them  that  the  Line  was  not
proposed to injure them, but that for a handsome consideration it was
intended to obtain a Cession of as much Land as would give the people
Room on the Frontiers  ascertain<hi rend="super">g</hi>  the  Boundary  at  the  same  time
between them &#8212; that with the help of proper  Laws  it  would  not  be
liable to intrusion &#8212; that the Line proposed at  Oriscany  interfered
with a patent granted above sixty years ago now in possession of some
Gentlemen at New York the Indian Deed for which, he had before  shewn
them That these Gentlemen and all others concerned would have  reason
to blame him for agreeing to lines so injurious to their Rights,  and
that the continuance of a line from thence in the  manner  that  they
proposed would in many places approach so near to our settlements, as
to render its duration very uncertain from the great increase of our

people, whereas by giving them more room the  Boundary  would  be  so
well known, and secured by Laws before there  would  be  occasion  to
invade it, that people would act with extreem caution and  rather  go
to other unsettled parts than attempt to transgress an  agreement  so
well defended &#8212;  That it had  been  long  in  agitation  and  was  now
according to their own desires ordered by His Majesty to be  settled,
as the surest means of putting and end to Land Disputes, and that  if
they rejected this opportunity now offered them and drew the Line  so
as to interfere with Grants, or approach allmost to our  settlements,
he could not see that any thing more effectual  could  thereafter  be
proposed for preventing encroachments,  and  the  Crown  after  being
already at a very heavy expense on this occasion must find  its  good
intentions and reasonable proposals totally  defeated.  He  therefore
recommended it to them to consider this point  farther,  and  as  his
Majestys Bounty, or that of the Colonys would be proportioned to  the
extent of their Cession, a rule which he  should  observe  upon  this
occasion &#8212; That he hoped for a more favorable Answer as it  would  be
more to their immediate  advantage  and  would  tend  to  the  better
observance  of  the  Line  hereafter.  After  these  and  many  other
arguments, &amp; farther explaining the several courses laid down  on
the draft, they agreed to take the Map back to their Council Hutt for
farther consideration, promising to use their Interest with the  rest
for a more favorable Line then withdrew Sir William assuring them  at
parting that they should be particularly rewarded for their  services
or  endeavours  to  shew  the  Indians  the  reasonableness  of   the
requisition. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>At night Tagawaron returned with the Map to Sir William,  informed
him that they were then debating on the subject but much  divided  in
opinion,  and  added  that  he  thought   his   Nation   disagreeably
circumstanced the rest having thrown so much of  the  transaction  to
the Northward on their hands, nevertheless he would do all  he  could
to obtain a more favorable settlement <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>After which Sir William had many other private  conferences  which
occupied a great part of the night &#8212; In particular Six Cheifs of  the
Oneidas, came to him at nine of the clock at night and they very much
doubted the validity of the purchase above Orisca &#8212; But through  <orig reg="Sir">S<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> Williams  solicitations  and  to  shew  their  good disposition towards compleating the work in hand,  they  would  agree
that the Line should run from the Susquehanna North  across  at  Fort
Newport near Fort Stanwix where the  Boats  are  launched,  and  from
thence to the Northwest corner of the late purchase for Lord  Holland
&amp; others &#8212; Sir William thanked them for the Amendments  but  told
them that he could not think it would answer, that it  did  not  even
include the carrying place,  and  therefore  desired  them  again  to
consider the matter and that as they could extend it much farther  to
the westward without any sensible  inconvenience,  he  expected  they
would do so, for which their Nation, over and besides the rest should
have five hundred Dollars &amp; a handsome present for  each  of  the
cheifs. &#8212; They promised to use their best endeavours for that purpose
&amp; withdrew <lb/></p>

<p><hi  rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Monday. Oct <orig reg="31st">31<hi rend="super">st</hi></orig></hi></hi><lb/></p>

<p>At 10 A M. The Oneidas returned to Sir Williams Quarters, and told
him that their people possitively refused to agree to any other  Line
than they had proposed the last night, &amp; that as  Game  began  to
grow scarce in their neighbourhood, they had come to a Resolution  to
keep the carrying Place to the Canada Creek in  their  hands,  as  by
keeping Horses and Carriages there as they proposed  to  do  for  the
future to carry over the Traders Goods, they might earn 

<pb n="125" />

somewhat  for
the support of their families. Sir William answered that  he  thought
it  somewhat  extraordinary  that  they  should  enter  into  such  a
Resolution on the sudden having totally neglected carrying goods  for
so many years &#8212;  That if  they  gave  it  up  they  might  still  reap
benefits from a high road open to all provided they had horses  &amp;
Carriages as reasonable as other people, but that their keeping it to
themselves would occasion many disputes between them  and  the  white
people, which His Maty was so very desirous  of  preventing  and  had
fallen upon the Boundary as the means of doing so. That  they  should
not stop at what was but a Trifle to them, tho' so advantageous &amp;
necessary to the English and that he wished they would so act  as  to
shew their love and respect for the King  &amp;  friendship  for  his
Subjects &#8212; That the Governor and People of New  York  had  reason  to
expect much more from them and that they had left it to him  to  urge
these matters to them as thinking Commissioners unnecessary  when  he
was to conduct the Congress. He hoped that this would  be  a  farther
consideration and desired them to act a part proper on  the  Occasion
<lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>The thereupon withdrew to consult further upon it. They shortly
after returned and said that Sir William had been so desirous to have
the Bounds further extended the last and only thing  they  could  say
was, that provided they were allowed an equal  use  of  the  carrying
Place with the English and to be paid  Six  Hundred  Dollars  to  the
Tribes over and besides the several Fees which were given in private,
they should extend the Line to Canada Creek Sir  William  finding  it
best not to urge this matter farther told them that he acquiesced for
the present leaving it to be confirmed or  rejected  by  His  Majesty
They answered that they  considered  and  unanimously  resolved  that
whatever Boundary Line was now agreed to should be for  ever  binding
&amp; conclusive on both sides &#8212; That  no  province  should  on  any
pretence  invade  the  Line  and  that  whatever  transaction   might
thereafter be necessary should be with  the  King  or  those  by  him
directed to treat with them. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>A Messenger then arrived to call them to attend  the  consultation
about the rest of the line <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>At night Canaquieson came to inform  Sir  William  that  they  had
further considered the general subject of the Line &amp; would send a
cheif &amp; Warrior from each Nation with their final resolves  which
they would deliver in public the next day - They accordingly came  to
Sir Williams Quarters, when Sir William told them, he hoped they were
now come with such an answer as would be pleasing to all Parties. The
Map being then laid before them, they said, that what they had to say
was the final resolves of all the Nations,  then  said  at  the  same
time, tracing it on the Map that they would agreeable to  their  just
Claims begin the Line at the mouth of the  Cherokee  River,  then  go
along to the South East side of the Ohio to Kittanning,  from  thence
to the Head of the West Branch of Susquehanna thence down the same to
Bald Eagle Creek thence across the River at Tiadaghta Creek below the
great Island, thence by a straight Line to Burnett's Hills and  along
the same to the mouth of Awanda Creek on the West Side  of  the  East
Branch of Susquehanna, thence up the stream thereof  to  Oswegy,<ref target="n125.01" n="1"></ref> thence Eastward to the Delaware River, thence up the stream
thereof till they come opposite to  the  mouth  of  Tianaderah  Creek
emptying into Susquehanna, thence up the West side of Tianaderrah  to
the head of its Westerly Branch, and from  thence  to  the  mouth  of
Canada Creek on Wood Creek. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>This they delivered  as  their  final  determinations  subject  to
several  conditions  for  the  security  of  their  possessions   and
engagements entered into, and for that part which would fall

within <orig reg="Mr">M<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> Penns <orig reg="Government">Gov<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> they
insisted on having 10,000 Dollars Sir William told them he would take
the matter into consideration and would assemble  them  all  tomorrow
and after parting conferred with  the  Commissioners  of  Pensilvania
concerning the same who <orig reg="approved">approv<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> it, and  agreed to the consideration on behalf of the Proprietors. <lb/><lb/></p>

<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Being all seated they desired to  know  whether  Sir  William  was
prepared to hear them, and on being answered in the affirmative,  the
speaker stood up and spoke as follows <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are hopefull that you will not  take  it  amiss  that  we  have
delayed till now our public answer on the subject you recommended  to
us, This was a great and weighty matter requiring long  deliberation,
and should not be undertaken lightly &#8212; We have accordingly considered
it, and are now come to give you our final  resolutions  thereon,  to
which we beg your attention <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We remember that on our first Meeting with you, when you came with
your ship we kindly received you, entertained you,  entered  into  an
alliance with you, though we were then great &amp; numerous and  your
people inconsiderable and week and we know that  we  entered  into  a
Covenant Chain with you and fastened your ship therewith,  but  being
apprehensive the Bark would break and your ship be lost we  made  one
of iron, and held it fast that  it  should  not  slip  from  us,  but
perceiving the former chain was liable to  rust;  We  made  a  silver
chain to guard against it Then,  Brother,  you  arose,  renewed  that
chain which began to look dull, and have for many years taken care of
our affairs by the command of the  Great  King,  &amp;  you  by  your
labors have polished that chain so that it has looked bright  and  is
become known to all Nations, for all which we shall ever  regard  you
and we are thankfull to you in that you have taken such care of these
great affairs of which we are allways mindfull, and we do now on  our
parts renew and strengthen the Covenant Chain by which we will  abide
so long as you shall preserve it strong &amp; bright on your  part.	A
Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are glad that you have opened the River and cleared  the  Roads
as  it  is   so   necessary   to   us   both.   We   were  <orig reg="promised"> promis<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> that when the war was over, we should have  Trade in plenty, Goods cheap and honest men to deal with  us  and  that  we
should have proper persons to manage all this.  We  hope  that  these
promises will never be forgot but that they will be  fully  performed
that we shall feel the benefits of an intercourse between us  &#8212;  that
the Roads and waters may be free and open to us  all  to  go  to  the
Southward, or for our friends from thence with whom  we  are  now  at
peace to visit us, that we may have proper persons in our Countrys to
manage affairs and smiths to mend our arms and implements  &#8212;  and  in
the expectation of this, we do, now on our parts open the  Roads  and
waters, and promise to assist in keeping them so. A Belt.  <lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Then after repeating all that had been said  concerning  the  Line
proceeded <lb/></p>

<pb n="127" />

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We have long considered this proposal for a Boundary  between  us,
and we think it will be of good consequence if you on your parts  pay
due regard to it, and we in  consequence  thereof  have  had  sundry
Meetings amongst ourselves and with you and from all  that  you  have
said to us thereon, we have at length  come  to  a  final  resolution
concerning it, and we hope that what is  now  agreed  upon  shall  be
inviolably observed on your parts as we are determined it shall be on
ours and that no further attempts shall be made on our Lands but that
this Line, be considered as final and we do now agree to the Line  we
have marked upon your Map, now before you on  certain  conditions  on
which we have spoken and shall  say  more  and  we  desire  that  one
Article of this our agreement be, that none of the Provinces or their
People shall attempt to invade it under color of any  old  Deeds,  or
other pretences what soever for in many of these things we have  been
imposed on, and therefore we disclaim  them  all,  which  Bounds  now
agreed to we begin on the Ohio at the mouth of  the  Cherokee  River<ref target="n127.01" n="1"></ref> which is now our just right, and from thence we give up
on the South side of Ohio to Kittanning above Fort Pitt, from  thence
a direct Line to the nearest Fork of the West Branch  of  Susquehanna
thence through the Allegany Mountains along the  south  side  of  the
said West Branch till we come opposite to  the  mouth  of  the  Creek
called Tiadaghton thence across the Nest Branch &amp; along the  East
side of that Creek and along the ridge of Burnets Hills  to  a  Creek
called Awandae thence down  the  same  to  the  East  Branch  of  the
Susquehanna, and across the same and up the East side of  that  River
to Oswegy, from thence Eastward to Delaware River, and up that  River
to opposite  where  Trinaderha  falls  into  Susquehanna,  thence  to
Trienaderha and up the West side thereof and its West Branches to the
Head thereof thence by a straight Line to the mouth of  Canada  Creek
where it emptys itself into  Wood  Creek  at  the  end  of  the  long
carrying place beyond Fort Stanwix, and this we  declare  to  be  our
final Resolves and we expect that the conditions of  this  our  Grant
will be observed A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>Now as we have made so large a Cession  to  the  King  of  such  a
valuable and Extensive Country, We do expect it as the Terms  of  our
Agreement that strict regard be paid to all our reasonable desires  &#8212; 
We do now on this on behalf and in the name of all  our  Warriors  of
every Nation, condition that all our Warriors shall have the  liberty
of hunting throughout the Country as they  have  no  other  means  of
subsistance and as  your  people  have  not  the  same  occasions  or
inclinations &#8212; That the White people be restricted  from  hunting  on
our side of the Line  to  prevent  contensions  between  us  A  Belt.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>By this Belt we address ourselves to the  Great  King  of  England
through You our superintendant in the Name and in behalf of  all  the
Six Nations Shawanese, Delawares and all other our  Friends,  Allies,
&amp; Dependants, We now tell the King that we have given  to  him  a
great and valuable Country, and we know that what we shall  now  get
for it must be far short of its value &#8212; We make  it  a  condition  of
this our <orig reg="Agreement">Agreem<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig> concerning the Line that His Majesty will not forget or neglect to show us His favor or suffer the Chain to contract Rust, but that he will direct those who have the management of our  affairs to be punctual in  renewing  our  antient  agreements.  That  as  the
Mohocks are now within the Line which we give to the 

<note id="n127.01" n="1">Now   called   the    Tennessee.    <hi rend="italics">Ramsey</hi>. &#8212;  E<hi rend="smallCaps">D</hi></note>

<pb n="128" />

King, and that these people  are  the  true  old  heads  of  the  whole
confederacy their  several  villages  and  all  the  Land  they  occupy
unpatented, about them as also the Residences  of  any  others  in  our
confederacy affected by this Cession shall be considered as their  sole
property and at their disposal both now, and so long as the sun shines,
and that all grants or engagements they  have  now  or  lately  entered
into, shall be considered as independent of this Boundary so that  they
who have so little left may not lose the benefit of the sale of it, but
that the people, with whom they have agreed, may have  the  Land  &#8212;  We
likewise further condition on behalf of all the Six Nations and of  all
our allies, friends &amp;  Nephews  our  Dependants  that  as  we  have
experienced how  difficult  it  is  to  get  justice  or  to  make  our
complaints known and that it is not in the power of our  Superintendant
to take care of our affairs in different Places without the Kings  help
that His Majesty will give him help &amp; strength to do us justice and
to manage our affairs in a proper manner. We all know the want of this,
and we make it a point of great consequence on which this  our  present
Agreement is to depend and without which Affairs will go wrong and  our
heads may be turned. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We likewise desire that as we have now given up a  great  deal  of
Lands within the Bounds that <orig reg="Mr">M<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> Penn claimed  a right of buying that he may in  consequence  of  the  agreement  now
entered into between us, enjoy what we have given within them Limits.
And as we know that Lydius of Albany  did  in  the  name  of  several
persons lay claim to Lands in  Pennsylvania,  which  we  know  to  be
unjust, and that the Deeds he pretends a right to  were  invalid,  We
expect that no regard will be paid to them or any such claims now  or
hereafter, as  we  have  fairly  sold  them  to  the  proprietors  of
Pensylvania to whom alone we shall sell Lands within  that  Province,
and we shall now give them a Deed for that &amp; other  Lands  there.
And in order to shew that we love justice, we expect the Traders  who
suffered by some of our dependants in the wars five  years  ago,  may
have a grant for  the  Lands  we  now  give  them  down  Ohio,  as  a
satisfaction   for   their   losses,   and   as   our   friend   <orig reg="Mr">M<hi
rend="super">r</hi></orig> Croghan<ref target="n128.01" n="1"></ref>
 long ago got a  Deed  for Lands from us, which may now be taken into  <orig reg="Mr">M<hi  rend="super">r</hi></orig> Penns Lands,  should  it  so  happen,  we  request  that  it  may  be considered and get as much from the King somewhere else, as he fairly bought it. &#8212; And as we have given enough to shew  our  Love  for  the King and make his people easy, in the next place we  expect  that  no
old claims which we disavow or new encroachments may  be  allowed  of
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother, <lb/></p>

<p>We have now gone through this matter and we have  shewn  ourselves
ready to give the King whatever we could reasonably spare. We on  our
parts express our regard for him and we hope for His favor in return.
&#8212; Our words are strong and our resolutions firm &amp; we expect  that
our request will be complied with in so much as we have so generously
complied with all that has been desired as far as was consistent with
our Existence A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Sir William then thanked them for what they had said, and  assured
them that it should all be considered, and that he  would  meet  them
tomorrow on these and other subjects. Then adjourned <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>The day being very rainy the Indians  did  not  meet  in  Council.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Sir William cloathed a number of cheifs and Cheiftains of  several
Nations and was this day busy in preparing the necessary  Papers  for
the Next Meeting <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>P. M. Sir William met the Mohocks and other cheifs and endeavoured
to persuade them to extend the Line more favorably to the West of New
York <orig reg="observing">observ<hi rend="super">g</hi></orig>  that  they  could  not  agree  to extend it further down the Wood Creek  on  the  South  side  that  he
expected they would let it run below the Canada Creek, on  the  North
side of Wood Creek, but finding them determined and  that  they  were
for closing it at the point of the  last  purchase  near  the  Mohock
River, he told them he would stop at the Mouth of Canada Creek  &amp;
refer the remainder to His Matys consideration <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Sir William then acquainted the Cheifs  that  his  Excellency  the
Commander in cheif purposed to evacuate Fort Ontario, or to put it on
the same footing with Fort  Stanwix,  as  a  measure  that  would  be
agreeable to them, and that as for any forts, which it was  necessary
still to keep up,  they  could  be  no  inconvenience  to  them  They
answered that they had nothing to complain of against the keeping  up
Ontario, on the footing it was for some time past nor would they make
any difficulty about the others whilst they were civilly  treated  at
them, and no encroachments made on  their  Lands  which  Sir  William
<orig reg="promised">promis<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> should be duly attended to.  <lb/><lb/>

<p>P. M. A  Deputation  from  the  Aghquessaine  Indians  came  to  Sir
Williams Quarters accompanied by the Oneida chiefs whose  interposition
with him had  been  requested  in  order  to  accommodate  the  unhappy
difference which had gone such lengths  in  their  village  that  their
Preist and many of their people  would  likely  be  murthered  A  Belt.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Sir William answered them that he had been extreemly concerned  to
hear of  that  difference  amongst  themselves  that  in  consequence
thereof he had directed Coll Claus the Deputy Agent for that  Quarter
to enquire into the particulars &amp; to put a stop to it,  and  that

<p>The Onondaga Speaker performed the Ceremony of Condolence,  for  a
loss sustained by the Oneidas after which Sir William  addressed  the
several Nations <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>After having duly considered your speech and the Agreement you  have
at length come into, I  am  pleased  to  find  that  you  have  so  far
dispatched business Notwithstanding the  severity  of  the  <orig reg="approaching">approach<hi rend="super">g</hi></orig> season, and the distance which many of us are  from our dwellings. I gave you all the  time  necessary  for  bringing  this weighty affair to a deliberate conclusion <lb/></p>

<pb n="130" />

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>I am glad to  find  that  you  remember  your  old  agreements  so
particularly and I wish you may always observe them,  and  with  that
view I should have been glad to have heard you confine your answer to
my Belt for keeping the Roads open, to that subject alone, as a  free
and safe intercourse between us is so  necessary  to  you  <lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>The promises formerly made you of the happy change which would be
produced by the  Reduction  of  Canada  you  have  in  many  respects
experienced as far as it was in the power of  his  Majestys  Servants
you likewise have had a considerable number of  Traders  amongst  you
which has so far lowered the Prices of Goods that several of them are
become Bankrupts and at many of the Posts they are to be bought at as
low rates as at our Towns Notwithstanding the distance and expence of
Transportation. I am to inform you that it has been judged adviseable
by the Government to commit  that  part  of  business  regarding  the
management of the Indian Trade  to  the  care  &amp;  charge  of  the
several Colonies who I make no doubt will endeavour to do every thing
they can for your interest A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>You have of late made several complaints on  account  of  the  ill
behaviour of some  people  on  the  Frontiers;  those  that  regarded
Pennsylvania, I have reason to think I finally  settled  and  gave  a
handsome  portion  of  their  bounty  upon  the  occasion,   and   in
consequence of the  information  I  gave  the  Governor  of  Virginia
thereon, his Assembly passed several Votes in your favour, which  are
now before me, whilst the Governor sent this assurance of their  good
faith and friendship for you and of their intentions to  prevent  you
from being ill treated <lb/><lb/></p>

<p><hi rend="center">Here showed and explained the  Resolves  of  the

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>I hope all this will convince you that they are your  friends  and
as further proof of it  the  Gentlemen  <orig reg="Commissioners">Comm<hi  rend="super">rs</hi></orig> from those Provinces will at their return take  proper  measures  for your future good treatment  &amp;  for  the  due  observance  of  the
Boundary Line by proper Laws for these purposes, according his  Matys
desires  which  I  shall  recommend  to  their  remembrance  A  belt.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>I am glad the Boundary is at length agreed upon, &amp; as  I  have
great reason to think it will be duly  observed  by  the  English.  I
recommend it to you  to  preserve  it  carefully  in  remembrance  to
explain it fully to those that are absent and to  teach  it  to  your
children. This Boundary is intended to be lasting but  should  it  be
found necessary by His Majesty  or  yourselves  to  make  any  future
additions or alterations he will treat with you by those who have the
management of your affairs. And never permit any private  application
this I have received in command to tell you <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>As to the several reservations you make in  your  Cession  to  the
King and the other points you recommend you may be assured  that  His
Maty shall be made acquainted with them, as I shall transmit to him a
copy of our transactions at this place &amp; I may venture to  assure
you that they will meet with all possible regard from a Prince of His
clemency &amp; Justice &amp; I now give you this Belt  to  strengthen
ratify  and  confirm  the  Boundary  to  all  transactions  necessary
thereto. A Belt. <lb/></p>

<pb n="131" />

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>The speech which you addressed particularly to His Maty  shall  be
faithfully transmitted to him with the rest of  your  proceedings.  I
have attended to the whole of it &amp; I persuade myself  that  every
reasonable article will be taken proper notice of &amp; that he  will
take such measures as to him shall seem best for your benefit and for
the rendering you justice &#8212; I likewise consider your good  intentions
towards the Traders who sustained the losses  &amp;  your  desire  to
fulfill all your other engagements as instances of your integrity.  I
wish that you may on your parts carefully remember  &amp;  faithfully
observe the Engagements you have now as well as formerly entered into
with the English, and that you may every day grow more  sensible  how
much it is your Interest to do so And I once more exhort you  all  to
be strong and stedfast to keep firm hold of the Covenant Chain  &amp;
never to give attention or credit to People who under the  Masque  of
friendship should come amongst you with stories  which  may  tend  to
weaken your attachment to us, but to  keep  your  eye  stedfastly  on
those whose business &amp; inclination it is to tell you truth  &amp;
make your minds easy A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers the Shawanese &amp; Delawares <lb/></p>

<p>I now particularly address you,  in  that  you  live  far  to  the
Southward, &amp; may at some times be disturbed by bad men who taking
advantage of our distance from us &amp; the Heads of the  Confederacy
may by Belts Messages or Stories invented to create  mischeif  impose
on many of your  people  &amp;  through  their  means  mislead  other
Nations I am not ignorant that this has happened &amp;  I  have  good
intelligence that there are people who  have  been  lately  deceiving
some of you with stories of Revolutions in American affairs &amp;  of
French Fleets &amp;  armies,  with  which  you  have  been  so  often
deceived that I wonder any of your people should  credit  them  &#8212;   Be
assured, Brothers, that those who were able to conquer Canada,  &amp;
drive their enemies out of their country,  will  always  have  it  in
their power to defeat their  future  projects  should  they  be  weak
enough to make any future attempts to regain what  they  lost.  I  do
therefore exhort you by this Belt to pay no regard to such  deceivers
for the future, but continue to live peaceably &amp; let me know  who
they are, &amp; from whence  that  attempt  to  impose  upon  you.  I
likewise desire you to remember all your engagements with the English
to observe the treaty of Peace  with  the  Cherokees,  to  avoid  any
irregularities on the Frontiers &amp; pay due regard to the  Boundary
Line now made, &amp; to make all  your  People  acquainted  with  it,
&amp; to keep the Roads &amp; Waters open and free whereby  you  will
enjoy the benefits of Peace &amp; Commerce, the esteem of the King of
Great Britain &amp; the friendship of all his subjects &amp; I desire
you will remember &amp; often repeat my words A Belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers the Indians of Canada <lb/></p>

<p>With this Belt I recommend it to you to  remember  what  has  been
done at this &amp; all former Treaties and to make  the  same  public
among all your people on your return to  Canada  recommending  it  to
them to continue to promote peace  and  to  discountenance  all  evil
reports &amp; idle Stories which may be propagated by ignorant or bad
men &amp; to communicate all usefull intelligence to me from time  to
time as a proof of your regard for your engagements &amp; a means  of
recommending yourselves to the esteem  of  the  King  and  people  of
England. A belt. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers of the <orig reg="several">sev<hi rend="super">l</hi></orig> Nations here  Assembled<lb/></p>

<p>The <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> of New Jersey being called hence by some urgent business has desired me to inform you  that  he  can  not
think of taking leave of His Brethren the Six  Nations  without  once
more

<pb n="132" />

expressing the Happiness he  has  received  from  finding  that  they
entertain such right sentiments of his justice,  &amp;  that  of  the
good people under his Government He has himself the highest sense  of
the value &amp; importance of the name conferred on him &amp;  doubts
not but that future Governors &amp; the cheif men  &amp;  inhabitants
of New Jersey will be ever carefull to  deserve  so  distinguished  a
Title among the Indian Nations as that  of  Sagorrihwhioughstha <ref target="n132.01" n="1"></ref> Doer of Justice <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>The Governor has likewise requested me to remind  you  that  at  a
Treaty held at Easton in  the  year  1758  the  Delawares  and  other
Indians who had any pretensions to Land in  New  Jersey,  did  for  a
valuable consideration give a general release for all  the  Lands  in
that Province except such parts as were reserved by Law for  the  use
of those Indians who chose to  live  under  the  protection  of  that
<orig reg="Government">Governm<hi rend="super">t</hi></orig>. This was done in  public  Council  in the presence of many of  the  Six  Nations  and  the  Governor  would therefore be glad, that at this Congress (where are present so  many
cheifs of the different Nations belonging to  the  Confederacy  &amp;
when a general Boundary Line between the subjects of  His  Brittannic
Majesty in America  &amp;  their  Bretheren  the  Indians  is  to  be
settled) you would do the Province  of  New  Jersey  the  justice  to
confirm the  said  Release  by  acknowledging  in  public  that  that
Province is entirely free from all Indian Claims,  except  as  before
<orig reg="mentioned">ment<hi rend="super">d</hi></orig> His Reason for this request is that  this matter may held in remembrance by all the nations  present  &amp;  by
that means be more surely handed down  to  their  Posterity  A  Belt.
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>In consequence of a Belt I have just received from the Senecas which
I formerly gave them to bind them together I do  now  think  it  highly
necessary  with  this  Belt  to  bind  you  all  together  <orig reg="recommending">recommend<hi rend="super">g</hi></orig> it to you all to avoid wandering and to continue at your several villages after the manner of your  ancestors,  I  do  this principally for your own advantage, convinced that you will be weakened by rambling and  that  your  Councils  and  opinions  will  be  thereby
disunited &#8212; Take therefore my advice and do not suffer yourselves to be
lead away with any imaginary prospects of advantage by scattering,  but
continue by this Belt in your several places of  abode  following  your
commerce and all peaceable pursuits A Large Black Belt <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brothers <lb/></p>

<p>The business of the Treaty being so  far  happily  brought  to  a
conclusion it only remains that you execute a deed of Cession to  His
Majesty &amp; whatever else is  necessary  on  this  occasion,  after
which I shall deliver over to your People the large Present, together
with the Sum of Money the amount and value of which  I  have  already
explained to you &#8212;  The  <orig reg="Governors">Gov<hi  rend="super">rs</hi></orig>  and  Gentlemen <orig reg="Commissioners">Comm<hi  rend="super">rs</hi></orig>  from  the  <orig reg="several">sev<hi  rend="super">l</hi></orig> <orig reg="Governments">Governm<hi rend="super">ts</hi></orig> are sensible  of  your  good  conduct
during the Treaty, and I shall recommend what is necessary to them in
your presence for its further security &amp; on the part of New  York
I take upon myself to promise you that every thing necessary  thereto
shall be recommended and I make no doubt agreed to by the Legislature
of this Province, heartily wishing that the same may on your parts be
as carefully observed &amp; that  no  disputes  may  hereafter  arise
concerning any part of the Cession you have made or  the  engagements
you have entered into at this time. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Then Sir William addressed the <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig>  of  New Jersey &amp; the Commissioners <lb/><lb/></p>

<note id="n132.01" n="1"><hi  rend="italics">supra</hi>,  p.  117.   &#8212; E<hi rend="smallCaps">D</hi>.</note>

<p>Gentlemen <lb/></p>

<p>Agreeable to His Matys intentions signified to me by the secretary
of State and  for  the  satisfaction  of  the  several  Nations  here
assembled I take the liberty to recommend it strongly to your several
Provinces to enact the most effectual Laws for the due observance  of
this  Line  &amp;  the  preventing  all  future  intrusions,  as  the
expectations thereof and  the  reliance  the  Indians  have  on  your
Justice from the Assurances I gave them  on  that  head  have  proved
great inducements to the  settlement  of  the  Line  now  established
between the Colonies and them <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>To this the Governors &amp; Commissioners  answered  that  nothing
should be wanting on their parts to the obtaining such  security  for
the Boundary as  was  deemed  necessary  on  their  return  to  their
respective Colonies <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Then Sir William at the desire of the Gentlemen  Commissioners  from
Pensylvania acquainted the Indians, that they the Commissioners  had  a
present ready to the amount of 500 Dollars to give in full satisfaction
of the Conostoga Lands, which by the death of that People became vested
in the Proprietaries &#8212; That they freely gave  this  sum  as  a  farther
Proof of the regard of that Province for them and of their concern  for
the unhappy fate of the Conostogas. Then Sir William told the  Indians,
that as the proprietaries did not know whether they would  chuse  money
or Goods for the  addition  of  Land  to  Pensylvania  they  were  then
unprovided, but that Sir William Johnson would be  answerable  for  the
speedy payment of the purchase, &amp; would propose to them  either  to
receive it in money to  be  sent  on  the  <orig reg="Commissioners">Com<hi  rend="super">rs</hi></orig> return or in goods speedy as possible or to wait till the  next  spring by which time they could have goods better  &amp;  more  for  the  same
money  from  England  which  was  submitted  to   their   determination
<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>As it grew late Sir William dismissed the Indians  till  the  next
day when they were to subscribe to the Deed of Cession &amp;  receive
the consideration <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>At night the cheifs came to Sir William told  him  that  they  had
considered the proposals made by the  Commissioners  of  Pensylvania,
&amp; preferred the receiving the purchase in Cash, as the  speediest
payment which was agreed to &amp; security given that the same should
be paid in Six Weeks <lb/></p>

<p>The Speaker after repeating what Sir had said to them on the first
Belt at the last Congress said <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We thank you for what you have said &amp; we are hopeful that  you
will observe your engagements as we mean to do on our parts;  but  as
this will in a great measure depend upon the Colonies, We now  desire
their Representatives here present to do every thing  for  preserving
those <orig reg="engagements">engagem<hi rend="super">ts</hi></orig> and  keeping  their  people  in good order A Belt. <lb/></p>

<pb n="134" />

<p>Then repeating what was said on the second Belt,  said  <lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We thank you for the advice you have given us  not  to  listen  to
evil reports or lies. <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We approve of your caution and shall observe it, and we shall from
time to time give us<ref target="n134.01" n="1"></ref>  the the  earliest  intelligence of any such Reports &amp; from whence they come  A  Belt.  <lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>Then in answer to <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi  rend="super">r</hi></orig>  Francklin's  Speech<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>We are glad to see that Governor Francklin is so well pleased with
our having bestowed one of our own names  upon  him  &amp;  are  well
pleased [to] hear you promise that he will always be ready to  do  us
justice We hope that all future Governors will act the same part.  We
acknowledge that several of our Nations now present were witnesses to
the transaction at Easton &amp; therefore acquit that Province of any
demand and we have only to desire of him to follow  your  example  in
his future Conduct towards us, which will sufficiently recommend  him
and his people to our esteem A Belt <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>Brother <lb/></p>

<p>The advice you gave us yesterday to continue firm and  united  and
to live together as formerly we think it very salutary  and  intended
for our Good. We are therefore intended to follow your  advice  shall
lodge your Belt at our Fire place at Onondaga to the end that all our
confederacy may have recourse to it &amp; act accordingly  <lb/><lb/>
</p>

<p>The Deed to His Majesty, that to the Proprietors  of  Pensylvania,
with that to the Traders being then laid on the Table  were  executed
in the presence of the <orig reg="Governor">Gov<hi rend="super">r</hi></orig> Commissioners,  &amp;  the  rest  of  the Gentlemen <lb/><lb/></p>

<p>After which the Cheifs of each Nation received the Cash which  was
piled on a Table for that purpose and then proceeded  to  divide  the
Goods amongst their People which occupied the remainder of  that  day

<p>P M The Governor &amp; Commissioners took leave  and  returned  to
their respive Provinces and that night Sir William took leave of  the
Cheifs recommending it  to  them  to  remember  what  had  been  then
transacted &amp; cautioning them against committing any Disorders  at
their Departure but to pack up their Goods &amp; return home in peace

New Jersey. succeeded Chief Justice Read on the  bench  on  the  17th
October, 1764, and continued in office  until  the  adoption  of  the
Constitution. In 1772 he was appointed one of  the  Commissioners  to
examine into the affairs of the burning of the British schooner Gaspé
by the Whigs of Rhode  Island.  When  the  Revolution  broke  out  he
removed to Philadelphia, where he died. His reputation as a judge was
highly respectable,  and  throughout  his  career  he  preserved  the
character    of    a    firm    and    consistent    Loyalist.    <hi

country of Western Virginia. In 1718 he crossed Powell's  valley  and
gave the name of "Cumberland" to the lofty range of mountains to  the
west, and passed a remarkable  depression  in  the  chain,  which  he
called  the  "Cumberland  gap,"  and  next  named  the  Shawanee  the
Cumberland river, all  in  honor  of  the  Duke  of  Cumberland.  <hi

Daniel Boone. <hi  rend="italics">Ramsey's  Tennessee</hi>,  65,  66.
