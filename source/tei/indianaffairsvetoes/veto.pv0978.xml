FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
RETURNING

WITHOUT APPROVAL SENATE BILL 4862, ENTITLED "AN ACT FOR THE RELIEF OF CERTAIN PERSONS HAVING SUPPLIED LABOR AND MATERIALS FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORK OF CONSTRUCTING THE CORBETT TUNNEL OF THE SHOSHONE IRRIGATION PROJECT," TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR IN RELATION THERETO.</head>

<salute>To the Senate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>For the reasons stated in the letter of July 12 of the Secretary of the Interior, which accompanies this message, I return without approval Senate bill 4862, entitled "An act for the relief of certain persons having supplied labor and materials for the prosecution of the work of constructing the Corbett Tunnel of the Shoshone irrigation project."</p>
<p>I do this because I think this legislation is of retroactive character and imposes on certain of the reclamation settlers an additional burden over and above the contract price of the work done, increasing that price by a double payment of part of what was due under the contract from the reclamation fund to the principal contractors. At the time when the work was begun and continued there was no law which relieved the subcontractor or the material man from the necessity of looking after the collection of what the contractor owed him or which imposed on the Government or the reclamation authorities the duty of seeing to it that the money paid under the principal contract was used by the principal contractor to pay his subcontractors or material men. To require that this additional amount should now be included in the assessment upon the lands is by law to increase a contract burden by a change of the character of the liability after it has been assumed and fixed. This is retroactive and is legislation in its nature unjust to the reclamation settlers.</p>

<opener>
<dateline>DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, July 12, 1912.</dateline>
<salute>MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:</salute> 
</opener><p>In reply to that portion of Mr. Hilles's letter of July 8, requesting information whether there is any objection to your approving S. 4862, "An act for the relief of certain persons having supplied labor and materials for the prosecution of the work of constructing the Corbett Tunnel of the Shoshone irrigation project":</p>
<p>The contractor for the construction of the Corbett Tunnel failed to comply with his contract, whereupon the work was completed by the United States through the Reclamation Service. Suits were begun by the United States on the contract and bond in the district of Montana, and to enforce a lien on the construction equipment in the district of Wyoming. In the latter suit a cross bill was filed by the concern that sold a portion of the equipment to the contractor. A tentative agreement for a settlement has been reached by the representatives of the bondsmen and of this department. The Department of Justice, however, holds that the settlement should be conditional upon the settlement of the Wyoming cross suit at the same time, and my latest advice is that none of the suits have yet been dismissed. The terms of settlement tentatively agreed upon included the payment of $42,000 by the bondsmen to the Government. This is only a fraction of the Government's claim, but is the most that it seems possible to recover.</p>
<p>The pending bill as originally introduced would have directed the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain and pay the laborers and material men's claims outright. As it now reads it gives the laborers and material men priority in recourse to the bondsmen over the claims of the Government. This reverses the existing rule of priority and returns to that prevailing before the act of February 24, 1905 (ch. 778, 33 <title>Stat.</title>, 811).</p>
<p>The proponents of the bill cite the act of March 4, 1911 (36 <title>Stat.</title>, 1170), as a precedent. That act reversed priorities on the Belle Fourche as Is now proposed for the Shoshone project. On the Belle Fourche project the contract was advertised before the rule of priority was changed by the act of 1905, though actually let thereafter. The pending bill would reverse the rule of priority although the contract was advertised several months after the rule of priority was changed by statute.</p>
<p>If the bill becomes a law, it will bring to naught the work done in instituting the suit and in protracted negotiations for settlement. The precedent will probably be followed in future cases with the result that the Government's security will be of little value in any case. I am of the opinion that reasonable security for the claims of laborers and material men should be given by the Government's withholding payment on the contract during a time fixed for the filing of notice of such claims, payment thereafter to be made to the contractor or claimant as may be ordered by the proper court. This would require general legislation.</p>
<p>The bill properly provides that the United States shall not be involved by It in any expense. The laborers and claimants who seek relief through the pending bill have suffered undoubted hardship. The effect of the proposed statute would be to shift that hardship to<pb n="3" />
<fw> VETO MESSAGE RELATING TO THE CORBETT TUNNEL.	3 </fw>
such water users on the Shoshone reclamation project, or the part of it served by the Corbett Tunnel, as hereafter settle upon the public lands or initiate irrigation on the private lands under the project. The Director of the Reclamation Service reports that there are approximately 150,000 acres of irrigable land in the whole project, of which but a small proportion is private or State land; that there are approximately 80,000 irrigable acres which will be served by the Corbett Tunnel, but that the expense of the tunnel has been charged upon the whole project and not merely upon the 80,000 acres; that about 22,000 acres are covered by existing water-right contracts with entrymen and private owners; and that about 12,000 acres are subject to existing public notices fixing the price of water rights to settlers who shall hereafter make entry, or private owners who shall hereafter contract for water from the project.</p>
<p>As to the 22,000 acres: The existing contracts, so long as they are fulfilled by the water users, are binding upon the United States. This fact precludes the shifting of any of the burden from the laborers and material men to water users on said 22,000 acres. As to the 12,000 acres: The department could cancel existing public notices and charge upon this 12,000 acres, together with other lands for which the price of water rights has not yet been fixed by any public notice, the expense of the proposed relief to the laborers and material men. To ascertain the area upon which this burden ($42,000) could be charged it is therefore necessary to subtract either 22,000 acres or 34,000 acres from the total irrigable acreage (150,000) of the project, or from the irrigable acreage (80,000) which will be served by the tunnel. The result would be a maximum charge of about 91 cents per acre and a minimum charge of about 33 cents. Since the director reports the average holding to be 60 acres, this would be a maximum burden of $54.60 and a minimum burden of $19.80 on each farmer (average).</p>
<p>The chief engineer of the Reclamation Service advises me that the water-right charge already imposed and to be imposed upon the lands in the project is, in view of the nature and value of the lands, now at the maximum of safety, and that the addition which the pending bill would render necessary would be a heavy burden upon all future settlers and water-right contractors and would seriously jeopardize the success of the project. Under these circumstances, I am reluctantly compelled to advise that the bill should not receive your approval. If the lands of the project were able to bear the additional charge I would gladly advise otherwise.</p>

<note>The Secretary proceeded to call the roll.</note>
<p>Mr. BRANDEGEE (when his name was called). I have a general pair with the junior Senator from New York [Mr. O'GORMAN]. He went away a few days ago, and I told him that he could rely on me to protect him. I certainly did not anticipate this situation, where I should be held by only one Senator when I was entitled to two on this occasion, where it requires a two-thirds vote. I do not know what entered into the other Senator's mind, but inasmuch as I have not notified him that he must come here and protect himself, I do not feel at liberty to vote. I therefore withhold my vote and protect my pair.</p>
<p>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN (when his name was called). I have a general pair with the junior Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. OLIvER]. I transfer it to the junior Senator from Maine [Mr. GARDNER] and will vote. I vote " yea."</p>
<p>Mr. CULLOM (when his name was called). I have a general pair with the junior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. CHILTON ] . If he were present, I should vote "nay."</p>
<head>Mr. GUGGENHEIM (when his name was called). I have a general pair with the senior Senator from Kentucky [Mr. P. PAYNTER] , Who is unavoidably detained, and therefore with-hold my vote.</head>
<p>Mr. LIPPITT (when his name was called). I have a pair with the senior Senator from Tennessee [Mr. LEA], and in his absence, not having notified him of a situation like this coming up, I feel that I should protect him, and therefore withhold my vote.</p>
<p>Mr. CHAMBERLAIN (when Mr. OWEN's name was called). I have been requested to announce that the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. OWEN] is paired with the senior Senator from Nebraska [Mr. BRowN]. I desire this announcement to stand for the day.</p>

<p>The SPEAKER. Two hundred and twenty-one Members are present, a quorum.</p>
<p>Mr. RAKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to dispense with further proceedings under the call.</p>
<p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
<p>The doors were opened.</p>
<p>Mr. RAKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield five minutes to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. MANN].</p>
<p>Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I examined this bill very carefully before it passed the House and thought that it ought to pass the House. Since the veto of the President I have gone over the papers again very carefully, including the report of the Secretary of the Interior, and, much as I desire to sustain a veto of the President, and as highly as I regard his opinion, I am constrained, in view of the facts in the case, to vote to override the veto of the President.</p>
<p>In this case the Government let a contract for the construction of a tunnel as a part of an irrigation system. The contract was let for less than the work could be done for, as it subsequently developed. The contract was forfeited, the contractor became bankrupt, and was unable to carry on the work. The Government finished the work. While the contractor was carrying on the work he bought supplies and issued pay checks to the laborers. The work and supplies went into the construction of the tunnel. The pay checks have not been paid. The supplies are not paid for. The Government has received trio benefit of the work and the benefit of the supplies. If the contractor had` failed a month or two before he did fail and the Government had proceeded to finish the work, as it did proceed afterwards to do, the Government would have been required to pay that much more money for the construction of the work than it did pay, namely, the amount represented by the pay checks and the amounts paid, due for supplies. I am not in favor of the Government taking the supplies or taking the labor of the laboring men and giving no chance for the payment of those bills. I believe the Government ought to secure the laborer his hire, because the laborer is worthy of his hire. I believe when the Government makes use of the supplies it ought to see that the bills are paid. In this case, as this work has all been done, for the purpose of carrying out the irrigation project and because the people who will occupy the land on the irrigation project will receive the benefit of the labor which is unpaid and of the supplies which yet remain unpaid for, I think they are the ones who ought to pay, and the pending bill only permits these people to intervene in the suit on the bonds which the Government took, and permits them to recover from the bondsmen. I am not willing to give my sanction to a proposition that the Government in constructing work can make use of labor which is unpaid for or make use of supplies which are not paid for. [Applause.]</p>
<p>I yield back the balance of my time.</p>
<p>Mr. RAKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of the time to the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. LAFFERTY].</p>
<p>Mr. LAFFERTY. Mr. Speaker, the bill now before the House, upon which Members are now about to vote, originated in the other body of Congress, and, therefore, was returned with the veto message to that body. It was considered in the Senate for two days, it was elaborately argued, and only 17 Members of that body voted to sustain the veto message of the President. The simple object of the bill is to give to those who put labor and materials into the construction of the Corbett Tunnel on the Shoshone irrigation project the right to sue upon the bond of the contractor or the subcontractor as they would have had the right to do under the law as it existed up to a few months prior to the letting of this contract. When this labor and material was furnished these people believed, and they had a right to believe, that they would be protected under the general law that obtains in every civilized country, that those who furnish labor and material in the construction of public works have a lieu upon those works for what they have furnished. I am very sorry that I have not time to go into the merits of the bill. I will simply state that when it came before the Committee on Irrigation of Arid Lands of the House of Representatives only three members of that body were opposed to its favorable consideration. It was reported favorably and passed through the House. I believe that it ought now to be passed again, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p>The SPEAKER. The time of the gentleman has expired. The question is, On reconsideration, will the House agree to pass the bill the objections of the President to the contrary, notwithstanding? The Clerk will call the roll. </p>
<p>The question was taken ; and there were&#8212;yeas 138, nays 77, answering " present" 12, not voting 163, as follows:</p>
