VETO OF H.R. 1977
MESSAGE
FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

TRANSMITTING
HIS VETO OF H.R. 1977, A BILL MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1996, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
DECEMBER 18 (legislative day, DECEMBER 15), 1995.—Message and accompanying bill referred to the Committee on Appropriations and ordered to be printed.


U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 29–011	WASHINGTON : 1995
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1977, the ‘‘Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996.’’
This bill is unacceptable because it would unduly restrict our ability to protect America’s natural resources and cultural heritage, promote the technology we need for long-term energy conservation and economic growth, and provide adequate health, educational, and other services to Native Americans.
First, the bill makes wrong-headed choices with regard to the management and preservation of some of our most precious assets. In the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, it would allow harmful clear-cutting, require the sale of timber at unsustainable levels, and dictate the use of an outdated forest plan for the next 2 fiscal years.
In the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest, the bill would impede implementation of our comprehensive plan for man-aging public lands—the Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Project. It would do this by prohibiting publication of a final Environmental Impact Statement or Record of Decision and requiring the exclusion of information on fisheries and watersheds. The result: a potential return to legal gridlock on timber harvesting, grazing, mining, and other economically important activities.
And in the California desert, the bill undermines our designation of the Mojave National Preserve by cutting funding for the Pre-serve and shifting responsibility for its management from the National Park Service to the Bureau of Land Management. The Mojave is our newest national park and part of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act—the largest addition to our park system in the lower 48 States. It deserves our support.
Moreover, the bill would impose a misguided moratorium on future listings and critical habitat designations under the Endangered Species Act. And in the case of one endangered species, the marbled murrelet, it would eliminate the normal flexibility for both the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to use new scientific information in managing our forests.
Second, the bill slashes funding for the Department of Energy’s energy conservation programs. This is short-sighted and unwise. Investment in the technology of energy conservation is important for our Nation’s long-term economic strength and environmental health. We should be doing all we can to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge, not back off.
Third, this bill fails to honor our historic obligations toward Native Americans. It provides inadequate funding for the Indian Health Service and our Indian Education programs. And the cuts targeted at key programs in the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ are crippling—including programs that support child welfare; adult voca-
(1)

tional training; law enforcement and detention services; community fire protection; and general assistance to low-income Indian individuals and families. Moreover, the bill would unfairly single out certain self-governance tribes in Washington State for punitive treatment. Specifically, it would penalize these tribes financially for using legal remedies in disputes with non-tribal owners of land within reservations.
Finally, the bill represents a dramatic departure from our commitment to support for the arts and humanities. It cuts funding of the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities so deeply as to jeopardize their capacity to keep providing the cultural, educational, and artistic programs that enrich America’s communities large and small.
For these reasons and others my Administration has conveyed to the Congress in earlier communications, I cannot accept this bill. It does not reflect my priorities or the values of the American people. I urge the Congress to send me a bill that truly serves the interests of our Nation and our citizens.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HASTINGS of Washington). Pursuant to clause 5 of rule I, the unfinished business is the question of the Chair's approval of the Journal of December 14, 1995.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996—VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 104-147)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-fore the House the following veto message from the President of the United States:
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1977, the "Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996."
This bill is unacceptable because it would unduly restrict our ability to protect America's natural resources and cultural heritage, promote the technology we need for long-term energy conservation and economic growth. and provide adequate health, educational, and other services to Native Americans.
First, the bill makes wrong-headed choices with regard to the managementand preservation of some of our most precious assets. In the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, it would allow harmful clear-cutting, require the sale of timber at unsustainable levels, and dictate the use of an outdated forest plan for the next 2 fiscal years.
In the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest, the bill would impede implementation of our comprehensive plan for managing public lands—the Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Project. It would do this by prohibiting publication of a final Environmental Impact Statement or Record of Decision and requiring the exclusion of information on fisheries and watersheds. The result: A potential return to legal gridlock on timber harvesting, grazing, mining, and other economically important activities,
And in the California desert, the bill undermines our designation of the Mojave National Preserve by cutting funding for the Preserve and shifting responsibility for its management from the National Park Service to the Bureau of Land Management. The Mojave is our newest national park and part of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act—the largest addition to our park system in the lower 48 States. It de-serves our support.
Moreover, the bill would impose a misguided moratorium on future listings and critical habitat designations under the Endangered Species Act. And in the case of one endangered species, the marbled murrelet, it would eliminate the normal flexibility for both the Departments of the Interior and Agri-culture to use new scientific information in managing our forests.
Second, the bill slashes funding for the Department of Energy's energy conservation programs. This is short-sighted and unwise. Investment in the technology of energy conservation is important for our Nation's long-term economic strength and environmental health. We should be doing all we can to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge, not back off,
Third, this bill fails to honor our historic obligations toward Native Americans, It provides inadequate funding for the Indian Health Service and our Indian Education programs. Anti the cuts targeted at key programs in the Bureau of Indian Affairs' are crippling—including programs that support child welfare; adult vocational training; law enforcement and detention services; community fire protection; and general assistance to low-income Indian individuals and families. More-over, the bill would unfairly single out, certain self-governance tribes in Washington State for punitive treatment. Specifically, it would penalize these tribes financially for using legal remedies in disputes with non-tribal owners of land within reservations.
Finally, the bill represents a dramatic departure from our commitment to support for the arts and the humanities. It cuts funding of the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities so deeply as to jeopardize their capacity to keep providing the cultural, educational, and artistic pro-grams that enrich America's communities large and small.
For these reasons and others my Ad-ministration has conveyed to the Congress in earlier communications, I can-not accept this bill. It does not reflect my priorities or the values of the American people. I urge the Congress to send me a bill that truly serves the interests of our Nation and out' citizens.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON. THE WHITE HOUSE, December 18, 1995,
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The objections of the President will be spread at large upon the Journal. and the message and bill will be printed as a House document.
MOTION OFFERED BY MR. REGULA
Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I offer a motion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion,
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. REGULA moves to refer the veto mes-sage and bill to the Committee on Appropriations.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. REGULA] is recognized for 1 hour.
Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY ] for purposes of de-bate only, and yield back 30 minutes,
0 1800
Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I did not understand the motion of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. REcuLA]. Is the gentleman trying to yield back half of the debate time?
Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. There will be 15 minutes on our side and 15 on the side of the gentleman from Wisconsin.
Mr. OBEY. So is the gentleman asking unanimous consent to yield back half the time?
Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I do not think we have to do that. I think I control the entire hour, and therefore, I

EXTENSION OF MOST-FAVOREDNATION TREATMENT TO PRODUCTS OF BULGARIA
Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1643), with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment, the Dole proposal, to open the Government, and that a motion to reconsider be laid on the table.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LAHOOD). Under the guidelines consistently issued by successive Speakers as recorded on page 532 of the House Rules Manual, the Chair is constrained not to entertain the gentleman's request until it has been cleared by the bipartisan floor and committee leadership.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state it.
Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the leader-ship on this side of the aisle has authorized me to make the motion I just did. Can we have any indication at all from the majority side as to whether or not there is any plan at all for them to allow the Dole proposal to be brought before us?
Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Regular order, Mr. Speaker.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is not a proper parliamentary inquiry.
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. ARMEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, we will now be turning our attention to special orders for a. period of time. During this period of time, the majority leadership will be working with and consulting with the majority Members on a broad range of questions and issues related to the temporary Government shutdown that has resulted from the President's veto of recent appropriations bills.
Mr. Speaker, we intend also during this period of time, while the House is entertaining special orders, to do some consulting with the minority leader-ship as well, and in anticipation of what might come of these sessions, I must advise the Members that until notified otherwise, we should expect that we would be coming back to the floor for business requiring votes at some time later in the day.
We will proceed with special orders; it would be my expectation that we would be able to come back, if things go well, and interrupt those. If not, and
