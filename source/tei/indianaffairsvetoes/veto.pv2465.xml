11129.150 BILLS DISAPPROVED AFTER SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT
The President announced his disapproval of the following bills with memorandums of disapproval as follows:
H.R. 3621
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval of H.R. 3621, which would establish, among other things, an Indian Development Finance Corporation that would be authorized to provide development capital to Indian businesses that meet certain criteria. The bill would have created an expensive and unnecessary new bureaucracy and duplicated currently existing programs. It would not have addressed the underlying problems of economic development in Indian country. Finally, the legislation places the Government at risk of substantial financial loss and does not provide sufficient authority for governmental oversight of the financial activities that could result in such loss.
Instead of creating a new institution to deliver additional capital, I believe that we need to better utilize existing sources of capital, including such Federal programs as the Indian Financing Act. In this regard, I recently signed Public Law 100-442, which increased the ceiling on guaranteed loans for Indian businesses under the Indian Financing Act from $200 million to $500 million, raised the limitation on loan guarantees to individual Indian and Indian economic enterprises from $350,000 to $500,000, and provided
other means for reservation economic development. Sufficient authority, therefore, exists to carry out the activities envisioned in H.R. 3621.
I would also emphasize that H.R. 3621, with its further proliferation of Federal credit programs, is contrary to this Administration's long-standing and ongoing efforts to manage more effectively Federal credit programs.
Because this legislation takes the wrong approach to Indian economic development, I am withholding my approval of H.R. 3621. I note that this bill also contains an unrelated and beneficial provision relating to the transfer of Federal land in Scuthern California to several bands of South-ern California Mission Indians. lily disapproval of H.R. 3621 does not affect this needed legislation, which was also included in H.R. 2677, an omnibus Indian affairs bill that I have already approved.
RONALD REAGAN. THE WHITE HOUSE, November 2, 1988.
H.R. 3966
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval of H.R. 3966, the "Children's Television Act of 1988". This bill would limit the amount of advertising during children's television programs to between 101/2 and 12 minutes per hour. It would also require the Federal Communications Commission, when reviewing an application for renewal of a television broadcast license, to consider whether the broadcaster has "served the educational and informational needs of children in its overall programming".
This Administration has firmly sup-ported the re-establishment of government and private sector policies sensitive to the needs of children and of the family. While I applaud efforts to increase the amount and quality of children's television programming, the Constitution simply does not empower the Federal Government to oversee the programming decisions of broad-casters in the manner prescribed by this bill.
Conditioning license renewals upon the Federal Government's determination as to the adequacy of a licensee's programming would violate the First Amendment. It would inhibit broad-casters from offering innovative pro-grams that do not fit neatly into regulatory categories and discourage the creation of programs that might not satisfy the tastes of agency officials responsible for considering license renewals.
The bill's limitation on advertising revenue for certain types of programming places the Federal Government in the inappropriate position of favoring certain kinds of programming over others. This type of government regulation may well undermine its stated purpose by discouraging commercial networks from financing quality children's programming. In addition, it raises constitutional issues both by

Memorandum of Disapproval for the Montana National Resources Protection and Utilization Act of 1988
November 2, 1988
I am withholding my approval of S. 2751, a bill "to designate certain lands in Montana as wilderness, to release other forest lands for multiple use management, and for other purposes." My Administration's National Forest System Land and Resource Management Plans for Montana already strike the appropriate balance among competing economic, environmental, and cultural interests in the National Forests of Montana. The provisions of S. 2751 would have severely disrupted that balance.
Enactment of the bill would injure the economy of Montana. It could cost jobs and eliminate vast mineral development opportunities. It also would reduce the flexibility the Federal Government needs in managing the Nation's natural heritage.
The legislation would constrain the ability of the Federal Government to obtain strategic and critical minerals. These minerals are necessary to supply military, industrial, and essential civilian needs during national defense emergencies and are not now found or produced in the United States in sufficient quantities to meet those needs.
Finally, the legislation would have provided for the Federal Government to ex-change revenue-producing Federal land for nonrevenue-producing land. The resulting loss in revenue to the Treasury would have increased the Federal deficit and imposed an unwanted and unneeded burden on the American taxpayer.

Proclamation 5894â€”50th Anniversary Year of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 1988
November 2, 1988

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Half a century ago, in 1938, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was signed into law by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This legislation was the start of modern food and drug regulation. That this year is the 50th anniversary of that legislation reminds each of us to be grateful for our American legacy of concern for protecting the public health.
The 1938 Act covered cosmetics, medical devices, food additives, and pesticides, but made its strongest impact by giving the Food and Drug Administration the authority and responsibility for approving new drugs for safety before they could be sold. These drug review provisions came just at the beginning of the "first therapeutic revolution," when penicillin and sulfa drugs were being discovered. Wave after wave of new drug classes were discovered in the 1940's and 1950's, and the new drug review system enabled patients and physicians to have a level of confidence in medications that had never before existed.
To this day, the Food and Drug Administration uses the provisions of the 1938 Act, as amended over the years, to establish rigorous standards for food and drug safety that are widely respected and emulated.
