1939	CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE	11227
which applications for benefits under the World War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended, may be filed.
This act would have provided an additional 5 years for filing claim for adjusted-compensation benefits; that is, from January 2, 1940, to January 2, 1945.
The World War Adjusted Compensation Act, which became law May 19, 1924, provided that application for benefits should be made on or before January 1, 1928. The amendatory act of May 29, 1928, extended the final date for filing application for benefits to January 2, 1930. The act of June 5, 1930, further extended the final date for filing application for benefits to January 2, 1935, and the act of August 23, 1935, extended the final date for filing application for benefits to January 2, 1940.
Under the original act the veterans and their dependents were granted approximately 3½ years and by subsequent liberalization have been given a period of over 15 years from the date of enactment of the original act in which to claim these benefits. During this period much publicity was given the original act and amendments, including the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, as amended, with every reason-able opportunity to file claim. This opportunity still exists and will continue to January 2, 1940.
Further extension of the period for filing claim in my opinion is not justified.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. THE WHITE HOUSE, August 10, 1939.
On August 11, 1939:
H. R. 3927. I have withheld my approval of H. R. 3927, a bill for the relief of Marijo McMillan Williams. The indebtedness to the United States represented in this bill resulted from the payment to Mrs. Williams the compensation of two positions, covering the same periods of time, in contravention of the act of May 10, 1916, as amended, notice of which act had been repeatedly given throughout the Postal Service by published bulletins of that Service. Such disregard of the law in this case, if condoned by the relief here sought, would result in the establishment of a precedent tending to induce disregard of this law and other laws en-acted for the purpose of limiting and restricting the expenditure of public funds.
For these reasons I do not feel justified in approving this bill.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. THE WHITE HOUSE, August 11, 1939.
H. R. 3959. I have withheld my approval of H. R. 3959, an act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of recreational demonstration projects, and for other purposes.
While the objective of this legislation is good, I am inclined to think that certain safeguards should at least be studied at the next session of the Congress.
It should probably be made more clear that equitable arrangements with local communities taking over such recreational projects should involve the Federal Government in no legal or moral commitments.
There should probably be a provision allowing departments of the Government to take over for their purposes such projects as it seems desirable for the Interior Department to part with.
Probably the approval of the President should be given to any transfers of these properties to local communities or other departments, as this is the general rule in similar cases.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. THE WHITE HOUSE, August 11, 1939.
H. R. 4117. I have withheld my approval of H. R. 4117, a bill to provide for the payment of attorney's fees from Osage tribal funds.
Briefly stated, this bill would authorize the payment of attorneys' fees in an amount not to exceed 121/2 percent of the funds collected as a result of any suit or suits brought under a contract between the Osage Tribe of Indians and certain attorneys named in said contract.,
HeinOnline- 84 Co
The customary percentage allowed by the Government to attorneys is not to exceed 10 percent. This bill, however, calls for 12½ percent, despite the fact that the Committee on Indian Affairs of the House of Representatives amended the bill to reduce the fees to 10 percent.
I agree with the recommendation of the committee and, therefore, cannot approve the bill.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. THE WHITE HOUSE, August 11, 1939.
H. R. 4482. I am withholding my approval of H. R. 4482, for the relief of Byron MacDonald.
The bill proposes to pay to Byron MacDonald the sum of $2,500 in full settlement of his claim against the United States for the death of his minor son, Richard MacDonald, who was killed on July 21, 1937, by a truck in the service of the Civilian Conservation Corps. An examination of the record in this case fails to disclose negligence on the part of any employee of the United States. The report of the inquest on the death of Richard MacDonald indicates that the boy met an accidental death. The report of the associate medical examiner states that the boy lost his balance and fell between the front and rear wheels of the truck. ,It is apparent from the record that the driver of the vehicle was proceeding at a reasonable rate of speed and that he used caution in attempting to pass the boy.
While the accident is regrettable, I find no justification for
any claim against the United States as a result thereof.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. THE WHITE HOUSE, August 11, 1939.
H. R. 5405. I am withholding my approval of H. R. 5405, authorizing the installation of parking meters and other de-vices on the streets of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.
This bill would authorize the Commissioners of the District in their discretion to secure and install, at no expense to the District, mechanical parking meters or devices on the streets, avenues, roads, highways, and other public spaces under the jurisdiction and control of the Commissioners; to make and enforce rules and regulations for the control of parking of vehicles on such public ways and other public spaces; and to prescribe fees for the privilege of parking vehicles where said meters or devices are installed. The bill also would provide that, in purchasing meters, the Commissioners may purchase 50 percent of the manually operated type meter, subject to specifications to be approved by the National Bureau of Standards, Department of Commerce.
While I have no objections to the general purpose sought to be accomplished by the bill, I believe its provisions as to the manner in which meters may be secured and funds made available for their payment are sufficiently vague and ambiguous to render the measure inoperative, if approved. Therefore, I am withholding my approval.
I would not object to future legislation to accomplish this same general purpose with all fees collected from such parking meters to be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the gasoline tax and motor-vehicle fees, highway fund, District of Columbia, and with authorization for the submission of estimates of appropriations, pay-able from such fund, for the purchase and installation of meters.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. THE WHITE HOUSE, August 11, 1939.
H. R. 5931. I have withheld my approval of H. R. 5931, a bill for the relief of Elizabeth Hessman.
The purpose of the bill is to pay the sum of $1,665 to Mrs. Elizabeth Hessman in settlement of her claim against the United States for personal injuries sustained when the car in which she was a passenger was struck, on April 27, 1936, by a Government car driven by an employee of the Soil Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture.
The record in this case indicates that there appears to be no serious or permanent injury which can be
