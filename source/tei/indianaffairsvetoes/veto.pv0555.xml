<head>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</head>
<quote>In re bills presented to the President less than ten days before the adjournment of Congress and not signed by him. In the case of each such bill, what was done with the engrossed copy of the bill, and what communication or memorandum was made in connection with such disposition?</quote> 
<p>Such unsigned bills are found in four places: in the custody of the Secretary of the Senate; in the custody of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress (where Presidential messages to the House of Representatives prior to the Civil War have been deposited); in the</p>
<fw> REPORT ON POCKET VETO	31 </fw><pb n="31" />
<p>greater than the sum thus sought to be released to him, I am not willing to agree to his release from the consequences of his failure to perform his contract.</p>
<p>I do not find unsigned bills in the archives of the State Department bearing any date between August, 1886, and December, 1892. Three bills of a later period were sent to that Department. With those three exceptions, all such unsigned bills after August, 1886, were retained by the President and are now at the Executive Offices.</p>
<p>The 49th Congress, second session, adjourned March 4, 1887. President Cleveland retained unsigned seven Senate and forty House bills. These bills have on them no markings except such as were made by the enrolling and comparing clerks of Congress, notations showing to what Department each bill was referred, the stamp showing when the bill was received at the Executive Mansion and in some instances an X in blue pencil. I shall give the number of the bill and the date on which it was received at the Executive Mansion.</p>
