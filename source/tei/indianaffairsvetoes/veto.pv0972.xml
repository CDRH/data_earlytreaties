<p>H. R. 32531 was received March 4. On the bill itself is penciled "Pocket."</p>
<p>The 62d Congress, second session, adjourned August 26, 1912. (<title>Cong. Rec.</title>, vol. 48, pt. 11, pp. 11881, 11903) President Taft retained unsigned S. 2534, on which no date was stamped; and H. R. 21708, which was stamped as received on August 20, and to which is attached a memorandum reading:</p>

<p>The 62d Congress, third session, adjourned March 4, 1913, the Senate legislative day of March 3 and the House legislative day of March 1. (<title>Cong. Rec.</title>, vol. 49, pt. 5, pp. 4842, 4856) President Taft retained unsigned two House bills.</p>
<p>H. R. 18213  &#8212;received March 1, 1913. On a memorandum which
is attached to the bill is the word "Pocket."</p>
<p>H. R. 23673&#8212;undated. Attached to the bill is the following type-written memorandum:</p>
<quote>
<p>Memorandum to accompany H. R. 23673. An Act to promote the welfare of American seamen in the merchant marine of the United States; to abolish arrest and imprisonment as a penalty for desertion and to secure the abrogation of treaty provisions in relation thereto; and to promote safety at. sea.</p>
<p>This bill is so important and conflicts in its operation with the treaty obligations of the United States and in its possible friction with the commerce of foreign countries that in the short time that I have had since it has been presented to me, I do not feel justified in assuming the responsibility of allowing it to become a law.</p>
