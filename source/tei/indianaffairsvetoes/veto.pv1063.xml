<salute>To the Senate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning herewith Senate bill 2301, "An act authorizing
the Shoshone Tribe of Indians of the Wind River Reservation in
Wyoming to submit claims to the Court of Claims," without my
approval.</p>
<p>The Fort Bridger treaty of July 3, 1868 (15 <title>Stat.</title> 673), set aside a
reservation for the Shoshone Indians and for such other tribes as
the Shoshones might "admit amongst them," but also provided
that no cession of any portion of the reservation should be valid
unless a treaty for the purpose should .be signed by a majority of
the male adult Indians of the Shoshone Tribe. Afterwards the
northern band of Arapaho Indians were located on the Shoshone
Reservation.</p>
<p>The Shoshone Indians claim that a majority of the male adult
Shoshones did not sign a treaty agreeing to the cession to the
Arapahoes of a portion of the reservation; that the consent, if any,
given by the Shoshones to the location of the Arapahoes on the
reservation was for temporary occupancy only; and that the
Shoshones have from time to time asserted that they should be
compensated for the land occupied by the Arapahoes.</p>
<p>It might be fair to say that these contentions may be disposed of,
it seems to me, by the fact that in 1896 and 1904 reservation lands<pb n="2" />
<fw> 2	VETO MESSAGE RELATING TO SHOSHONE CLAIMS </fw>
were ceded by agreements signed by both the Shoshones and the Arapahoes which provided that the moneys received therefor should be divided between the Shoshones and the Arapahoes. Congress ratified these agreements, and they were carried into effect. Still, this objection might not be fatal.</p>
<p>But aside from the question of the merit of the claim the enrolled bill is objectionable because of the provision for the payment of interest from the date of origin of the claim. It had never been Government policy, prior to the Crow Indian jurisdictional act of July 3, 1926, to provide for the payment of interest from the date of origin of a claim. I am now satisfied that further departure from our former policy would be unjustified. It seems to me unreason-able to expect that the Government should be charged with interest from the dates of origin of such ancient claims. The amount of the interest under the enrolled bill is several times greater than the amount of the principal. Such an interest policy would inevitably mean that issues supposed to have been placed in the way of fair determination by jurisdictional acts of the past will come forward again for additional interest settlements far exceeding the amounts of the original claims. Should the item of interest be eliminated, I can now see no reason why the bill should not be approved. But if interest is to be allowed on this claim, it will certainly result in an effort to reopen an endless number of claims which have already been settled.</p>

<p>SEC. 3. In said suit the court shall also hear, examine, and adjudicate any claims which the United States may have against said tribe, but any payment including gratuities which the United States may have made to said tribe shall not operate as an estoppel, but may be pleaded as an offset in such suit: Provided, however, That the United States may interpose to such suit or action any and all pleas of defense, affirmative and negative, legal and equitable, which it may have thereto not herein specifically barred by the provisions of this Act.</p>
<p>SEC. 4. If it be determined by the court that the United States, in violation of the terms and provisions of any law, treaty, or agreement, has appropriated or disposed of any lands, money, or other property belonging to the Indians, damages therefor shall be confined to the value of the money, lands, or other property at the time of such appropriation or disposal, together with interest thereon at 5 per centum per annum from the date thereof; and with reference to all claims which may be the subject matter of the suits herein authorized, the decree of the court shall be in full settlement of all damages, if any, committed by the Government of the United States and shall annul and cancel all claim, right, and title of the said Shoshone Indians in and to such money, lands, or other property.</p>
<p>SEC. 5. Upon final determination of such suit or suits the Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to fix and determine a reasonable fee, not to exceed 10 per centum of the recovery, together with all necessary and proper expenses incurred in preparation and prosecution of the suit, to be paid to the attorneys employed by said Shoshone Tribe of Indians, and the same shall be included in the decree and shall be paid out of any sum or sums found to be due said tribe.</p>
<p>SEC. 6. The Court of Claims shall have full authority by proper orders and process to bring in and make parties to said suit any or all persons deemed by it necessary or proper to the final determination of the matters in controversy.</p>
<p>SEC. 7. A copy of the petition in such suit shall be served upon the Attorney General of the United States, and he, or some attorney from the Department of Justice to be designated by him, is hereby directed to appear and defend the interests of the United States.</p>
<p>SEC. 8. All amounts which may be found due and recovered for said tribe under the provisions of this Act, less attorneys' fees and expenses, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of said tribe and shall draw interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of the judgment or decree.</p>

<fw> 2414	CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE	JANUARY 28 </fw>
<p>have been heretofore, but they are unspeakably lower in comparison with the prices of the commodities which are made out of the raw materials produced on the farm and which hi turn the farmer must consume.</p>
<p>As I have previously stated, there is being blazoned abroad to the country the information that incomes were never so great as now. They have grown so great that the revenues of the Government, derived from our new method of taxation, have exceeded even the careful calculations of the actuary of the Government. That is largely due to the fact that the price of the raw material is down to where it does not pay the cost of production under modern conditions.</p>
<p>We are engaged every day in proposing and passing legislation directly affecting and protecting the industrial interests of the country, while not a single practicable law has been placed upon our statute books meeting the necessity of that peculiar form of industry which is known as agriculture.</p>
<p>Mr. President, in conclusion I merely wish to say that it is the duty of this Congress, even though the supply bills, including the deficiency bills, shall not be enacted into law, to address itself to the horrible condition in which agriculture finds itself, and to seek a solution, even though such legislation should break every precedent under our form of government. The sustaining of our farms, the health of our agricultural interests are of more importance than even our winning the World War, because we fought that war to " make America safe for democracy"; but what shall it profit us, though we won the war, if we undermine the very foundation of the Government which we sent those millions of soldiers to protect? We can not sustain this Government so long as we address ourselves and our legislation to fostering and promoting one class of our citizens to the destruction of another class. It is for this reason that I have read these letters and have male the plea which I have presented. While the statement is being made that such prosperity was never before known in the history of America, yet the voice of 30,000,000 who are being crucified under existing conditions falls on no willing ears amongst the powers that be.</p>
<p>The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill is still as in Committee of the Whole and open to amendment. If there are no further amendments to be proposed, the bill will be reported to the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill was reported to the Senate as amended, and the amendments were concurred in.
The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time.</p>
<p>The bill was read the third time, and passed.</p>
