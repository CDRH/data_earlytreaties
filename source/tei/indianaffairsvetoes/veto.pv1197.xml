<fw> 12456	CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE	JUNE 18 </fw>
<p>abilities directly incurred in or aggravated by active military or naval service in the World War.</p>
<head>DISAPPROVALS OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS</head>
<p>The President of the United States, on June 26, 1934, issued the following statement for the press, a copy of which he transmitted to the Secretary of the Senate</p>:
<p>The Constitution of the United States, with reference to bills presented to the President by the Congress, provides:</p>
<p>"If any bill shall not be returned by the President within 10 days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law."</p>
<p>In the past it has been customary in most cases involving vetoes for the President to withhold his signature, thereby, in effect, allowing the bill to die without becoming a law.
The President has desired, however, to take a more affirmative position than this, feeling that in the case of most legislation reasons for definite disapproval should be given. Therefore, he has written on the copy of each bill the words " Disapproved and signature withheld ", and has appended in every case a brief statement giving the reason or reasons for disapproval.</p>
<p>The bills identified below have been vetoed by the President, and the reasons which lead to their disapproval are contained in the following statements:</p>
<p>H.R. 7711. " I disapprove H.R. 7711, entitled `An act to permit postmasters to act as disbursing officers for the payment of traveling expenses of officers and employees of the Postal Service.'</p>
<p>"Section 4 of Executive order of June 10, 1933, No. 6168, relating to the organization of executive agencies, provides in part:</p>
<p>"`The function of disbursement of moneys of the United States exercised by any agency is transferred to the Treasury Department and, together with the office of disbursing clerk of that Department, is consolidated in a Division of Disbursement, at the head of which shall be a chief disbursing officer.'</p>
<p>"That consolidation of disbursing functions is now being perfected, subject to the provisions contained in Executive Orders Nos. 6727 and 6728, of May 29, 1934, and I am therefore not in favor of this bill, which would apparently in-validate, to the extent therein set forth, the consolidation of disbursing functions as provided in said Executive order of June 10, 1933."</p>
<p>S. 1358. "I disapprove Senate bill 1358 entitled `An act to provide for the improvement of approaches to the National Cemetery and the Confederate Cemetery at Fayetteville, Ark.'</p>
<p>"This bill would require the Highway Department of the State of Arkansas to expend not to exceed $12,800 out of Public Works allocations, in the construction of an 18-foot concrete pavement on approaches to the National Cemetery and to the Confederate Cemetery at Fayetteville, Ark.</p>
<p>"The Government-owned approach road to the National Cemetery was conveyed to the city of Fayetteville by the Secretary of War on July 7, 1926, pursuant to the act of March 3, 1925 (43 <title>Stat.</title> 1104), and the city assumed the obligation to maintain that road.</p>
<p>"This bill would divert Public Works funds granted to the Highway Department of the State of Arkansas, which are required to be expended under the provisions of the Federal Highway Act, to the construction of streets in a city that are not part of the Federal highway system.</p>
<p>"The improvement of any particular road and the type of improvements which shall be made are engineering matters to be determined in the light of traffic conditions and the availability and suitability of materials. The policy of determining these matters and what roads shall be so improved under our Federal aid highway system has been wisely vested in the Secretary of Agriculture, and I am not in favor of departing from that policy as proposed in this bill."</p>
<p>H.R. 8587. An act to extend the benefits of the Employees' Compensation Act of September 7, 1916, to William Thomas.</p>
<p>"This bill is defectively drawn; and in addition the War Department has no record of the injury alleged."</p>
<p>H.R. 4957. An act for the relief of F. M. Peters and J. T. Akers.</p>
<p>"I cannot agree that reasonable care was exercised by these postmasters, and must, therefore, approve the recommendation of the Post Office Department."</p>
<p>H.R. 8728. An act authorizing the Secretary of War to lease or sell certain lands or buildings known as "Camp Eagle Pass, Tex.", to the city of Eagle Pass, Tex.</p>
<p>"I cannot approve this bill in its present form. The object is worthy, but the Government's rights are not sufficiently protected."</p>
<p>H.R. 363. An act for the relief of James Moffitt.</p>
<p>"It does not seem reasonable to believe that malaria and large doses of quinine prevented this man from knowing he was deserting, in view of the fact that he thereafter stayed in Chicago for a year and then went home without apparently trying in any way to clear his record."</p>
<p>H.R. 3161. "I disapprove House bill no. 3161, entitled `An act for the relief of Henry Harrison Griffith.'</p>
<p>"The bill authorizes and directs the Employees' Compensation Commission to extend the benefits of the Employees' Compensation Act of September 7, 1916, to a former civil employee of the United States in the same manner and to the same extent as if application for such benefits had been made within the 1-year period required by sections 17 and 20 of the Compensation Act.</p>
<p>"The bill is objectionable because it does not limit the benefits to the date of the approval of the bill, and further, the bill as drawn does not authorize the Commission to examine into the merits of the claim."</p>
<p>H.R. 2632. An act for the relief of Wilson G. Bingham.</p>
"Because this officer voluntarily resigned 4 years after the close of the World War, he should <p>not now be reinstated and retired as a captain.</p>
<p>"I would approve a bill to extend to him the benefits of the Emergency Officers' Retirement Act."</p>
<p>H.R. 8517. An act to provide for needy blind persons of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>"I am compelled to agree with the adverse reports on this bill made by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia and the Director of the Budget.</p>
<p>"I therefore reluctantly disapprove the bill."</p>
<p>S. 3446. An act to authorize the Postmaster General to receive, operate, and maintain for official purposes motor vehicles seized for violations of the customs laws.</p>
<p>"Disapproved because I do not wish to establish the habit of providing passenger automobiles for postal employees."</p>
<p>H.R. 3054. An act for the relief of Christopher Cott.</p>
<p>"Nothing in this record extenuates the circumstance of desertion except his service during the actual war period. The bill is therefore disapproved."</p>
<p>H.R. 5018. An act to correct the naval records of former employees of the crews of the revenue cutters Algonquin and Onondaga.</p>
<p>"This bill is disapproved because it stretches the imagination to declare men on a revenue cutter for 17 days on the Great Lakes in August 1898 to be entitled to all the privileges of Spanish War veterans."</p>
<p>H.R. 1766. An act to provide medical services after retirement on annuity to former employees of the United States disabled by injuries sustained in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p>"I am disapproving this bill because I fear that if this principle is established it will grow and grow like war pensions, and that would be a pity for our children and grand-children."</p>
<p>H.R. 5864. An act to authorize the payment of expenses of delegates of the Yakima Confederated Tribes of Indians while on a mission to represent such tribes before Congress and the executive departments at the seat of government, and for other purposes.</p>
<p>"I understand the established policy is to charge expenses of this character to tribal funds instead of to the Treasury. The bill is therefore disapproved."</p>
