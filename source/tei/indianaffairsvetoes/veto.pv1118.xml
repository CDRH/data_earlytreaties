<salute>To the Senate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning herewith Senate bill 826, "An act conferring jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to hear and determine claims of certain bands or tribes of Indians residing in the State of Oregon," without my approval.</p>
<p>The bill limits the claims which can be presented to those "arising under or growing out of any treaty, agreement, act of Congress, Executive order," and then throws the door wide open by adding "or otherwise." I can not assent to the proposition that the Government should be obligated after 75 years to defend a suit for unknown claims of such ancient origin and for persons long since dead not based upon any treaty, agreement, act of Congress, or Executive order.</p>
<p>I want full justice for our Indian wards, and would have no objection to the presentation of claims arising under the treaties named in the bill, both ratified and unratified treaties. I am advised, however, that all funds promised to these Indians under the ratified treaties have been appropriated and paid, and that lands were set aside for and occupied by the Indians who were parties to the unratified treaties. I am further constrained to this action at a time when the Government can not assume additional and unknown burdens of expenditure.</p>

That if any claim or claims be submitted to said courts hereunder they shall settle the rights therein, both legal and equitable, of each and all the parties thereto, notwithstanding the lapse of time or the statutes of limitation; and any payment which may have been made upon any such claim shall not operate as an estoppel but may be pleaded as a set-off, and the United States shall be allowed to plead and shall receive credit for all sums, including gratuities if properly chargeable, paid to or expended for the benefit of any of said nations, tribes, or bands of Indians. The claim or claims of each nation, tribe, or band may be presented separately or jointly by petition, subject, however, to amendment and consolidation in proper cases.

<p>The petition shall set forth all the facts upon which the claims are based and the laws, treaties, agreements, Executive orders, or wrongful actions of the Government under and upon which recovery is sought, and shall be signed and verified by the attorney or attorneys employed to prosecute such claim or claims and who are under contract with said Indians approved in accordance with existing law.

<p>Official letters, papers, documents, and public records, or certified copies thereof, may be used in evidence, and the departments of the Government shall allow the attorney or attorneys access to such treaties, papers, correspondence, or records as may be proper.</p>
<p>SEC. 3. Upon final determination of such suit or suits the Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to fix and determine a reasonable fee, not to exceed 10 per centum of the recovery, based upon actual services rendered, together with all necessary and proper expenses incurred in the preparation and prosecution of the suit or suits, to be paid to the attorney or attorneys employed by said nations, tribes, or bands of Indians; and if not otherwise paid, the same shall be included in the decree and shall be paid out of any sum or sums found to be due said Indians.</p>
<p>SEC. 4. The proceeds of all amounts, if any, recovered for said Indians, less attorneys' fees and expenses, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Indians decreed by said court to be entitled thereto, and shall draw interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of the original judgment or decree, and thereafter shall be subject to appropriation by Congress for educational, health, industrial, and other purposes for the benefit of said Indians, including the purchase of lands and building of homes.</p>

<p>The Chaplain, Rev. ZeBarney T. Phillips, D. D., LL. D., offered the following prayer:</p> <p>
Almighty and Eternal God, whose will doth sway the destiny of the universe and of human life, before whose eyes nothing is covered or concealed; preserve us in our secret life from all idle reverie, from all impurity of thought, from moments of self-pity, pride, and petulance, and give to us the inner calm, the fine serenity of souls principled in faith and hope and love.</p>
<p>Touch Thou our lips with kindly wisdom, that with grace and clearest insight our words may rise on winged feet above confusion's wide expanse, clothing our thought with the rare bloom and fragrance of that knowledge which reveals the constant inflowing of God into the affairs of men. We ask it in the name and for the sake of Him who spake as never man spake, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
