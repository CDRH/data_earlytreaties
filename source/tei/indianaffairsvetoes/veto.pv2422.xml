January 22, 1 985	CONGRESSIONAL RECORDâ€”SENATE	733
third year under S. 607, combined funding would be $290 million, a 67 percent increase from the current budget year. Under present fiscal conditions, unrestrained increases of this magnitudeâ€”no matter how worthy the programsâ€”are unacceptable.
Legislation that provides for Federal support of public broadcasting at realistic and reasonable levels and that provides public broadcasters with the means and incentives to explore alter-native revenue sources would be both appropriate and welcome. If, however, we are to succeed in reducing Federal spendingâ€”as we mustâ€”the levels of spending contemplated by S. 607 cannot be justified.
In withholding my approval of S. 607, I want to emphasize that the continued operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are not at risk. Funds for the Corporation have al-ready been appropriated for 1985 and 1986, and funds for 1987 are contained in H.R. 6028, the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education 1985 appropriations bill, which recently passed both Houses of Congress.
I vetoed an earlier version of this legislation on August 29, 1984, for precisely the same reasons that I am withholding my approval of S. 607. I will continue to oppose and reject bills of this nature until and unless Congress presents me with a bill that is consistent with sound budget policy. This one is certainly not, and I decline to approve it.
RONALD REAGAN. THE WHITE HOUSE. October 19, 1984.
S. 1097
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I have withheld my approval from S. 1097, the "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atmospheric and Oceanic Research and Services Act of 1984." S. 1097 would, among other things, authorize appropriations for various National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) programs for fiscal year 1085, for which appropriations have already been enacted.
S. 1097 also contains, however, a number of undesirable provisions that would unduly effect the ability of the Department of Commerce to manage Its programs responsibly and effectively. The provisions in Title VI concerning the closings and consolidations of National Weather Service offices are particularly onerous and would have the effect of virtually precluding the consolidation or closing of such offices, even when such closings or consolidations are fully justified.
In addition, S. 1097 contains other highly objectionable provisions concerning the Department's activities. Section 205 of S. 1097 would result in excessive and unjustifiable delays in Department contracting-out activities, even when such contracting would bein the clear interest of the Nation's taxpayers. And, Section 202(b), which concerns the weather satellite pro-gram, is objectionable because it would lessen the Secretary of Commerce's discretion in managing that program, as well as require the inefficient use of a government asset.
This act represents an unwarranted intrusion by Congress into matters normally and properly within the management discretion of the Executive branch. In the interest of efficient and economical conduct of government activities, therefore, I am con-strained to withhold my approval of S. 1097.
RONALD REAGAN. THE WHITE HOUSE, October 19, 1984.
S.2166
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL.
I am withholding my approval of S. 2166, the "Indian Health Care Amendments of 1984," which would extend and amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.
Although I fully support the intent and objectives of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, I believe this bill is seriously deficient in fulfilling those goals. My disapproval of the
will in no way affect the continued de-livery of health care services to our country's Indian population. Earlier this month I signed the Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1985, which includes $855 million for the Indian Health Service, an increase of $30 million over the prior year.
A number of serious flaws in S. 2166 compel my disapproval of this bill. Two provisions are especially trouble-some.
First, a provision that I find totally unacceptable would actually reduce access to health services for Indians. That provision would have the effect of making Indians residing in Montana ineligible for certain benefits of State and locally supported health programs until and unless the availability of such benefits from the Indian Health Service has been exhausted. In my view, this provision for Indian citizens of Montana would set a precedent for potentially changing the fundamental relationship of the Indian Health Service to State and Iocal entities, as well as depriving eligible Indians of benefits that should be due them by virtue of their citizenship in the State. As a matter of both principle and precedent, I cannot accept this provision.
Second, the mechanism established in section 802(d) of the bill for effecting the removal of the Indian Health Service from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is unconstitutional and can have no legal effect. The Department of Justice has advised me that the Congress may not constitutionally delegate to acongressionally appointed body, such as the Commission on the Organizational Placement of the Indian Health Service established by this bill, the legislative authority to determine when legislation will take effect. Be-cause section 602(d) does not comply with the clear requirements of the Constitution, I cannot give my approval to this bill.
Other serious flaws in S. 2166 that compel my disapproval would: â€”duplicate existing authorities in
most of its provisions; â€”unnecessarily and	wastefully
change the organization of the
Indian Health Service; and
â€”	place increased emphasis on services that are not oriented toward the primary mission of the Indian Health Service.
The bill would allocate a significant portion of funding for various peripheral projects, such as unnecessary re-ports, interagency agreements, and regulations development. This would lead either to an unacceptable in-crease in total funding or to under-funding of the most critical areaâ€”provision of clinical health services to reservation Indians. The Administration has, on the other hand, proposed using most Indian health funds for this purpose, so that resources can be most effectively spent where the need is the greatest.
For all these reasons, I find S. 2166 unacceptable.
As I indicated earlier, the action I am taking will have no adverse impact on the delivery of health services to Indians living on or near a reservation because the existing provisions of the Snyder Act provide all necessary authority for such services. Since 1955, utilizing the Snyder Act authorities:
-	30 hospitals have been construct-
ed;
-	30 clinics and 58 field health stations have been constructed;
â€”Annual admissions to Indian Health Service and contract hospitals have more than doubled; out-patient visits have multiplied by approximately eight times; and the number of dental services provided has increased ten-fold.
Even more important are the
achievements in terms of improved
health status, which is, after all, the
goal of the Indian Health Service:
â€”The infant mortality rate has de-creased by 77 percent and the maternal death rate by 86 percent;
â€”	The death rate resulting from pneumonia and influenza has de-creased by 73 percent: and
â€”	Death from tuberculosis has been reduced by 94 percent and the incidence of new active tuberculosis has been reduced by 84 percent.
Over the last decade, the Federal
Government has supported the Indian
Health Service with over $5 billion.
HeinOnline- 131 Cong.Rec. 733 1985
734	CONGRESSIONAL RECORDâ€”SENATE	January 22, 1985
The last budget that I submitted to the Congress projected spending an additional $4 billion through 1989.
My Administration's commitment to ensuring the continuing improvement of health services delivery to Indian people and Alaska natives is strong and clear.
