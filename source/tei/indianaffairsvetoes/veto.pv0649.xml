<head>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</head>
<p>In re bills presented to the President less than ten days before the adjournment of Congress and not signed by him. In the case of each such bill, what was done with the engrossed copy of the bill, and what communication or memorandum was made in connection with such disposition?</p>
<p>Such unsigned bills are found in four places: in the custody of the Secretary of the Senate; in the custody of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress (where Presidential messages to the House of Representatives prior to the Civil War have been deposited); in the</p>
<fw> REPORT ON POCKET VETO .	33 </fw> <p>where the death was I am afraid much more remotely connected with army disability.</p>
<p>But I do not feel that I can sign a bill directing a pension he awarded only and expressly upon the theory that death was not chargeable to military service. This would not only make what is called a pension an admitted granting of gifts but would set a precedent of the most dangerous kind and fraught with deplorable results.</p>
