<head>MESSAGE

FROM


THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

RETURNING

WITHOUT APPROVAL THE ENROLLED BILL (H. R. 5918) WHICH WOULD AMEND PUBLIC LAW NO. 96 OF THE SEVENTY-FIFTH CONGRESS, BEING AN ACT ENTITLED "AN ACT AMENDING SECTION 2 OF PUBLIC LAW NO. 716 OF THE SEVENTY-FOURTH CONGRESS, BEING AN ACT ENTITLED 'AN ACT TO RELIEVE RESTRICTED INDIANS WHOSE LANDS HAVE BEEN TAXED OR HAVE BEEN LOST BY FAILURE TO PAY TAXES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES'"</head>
<p>June 11, 1940.&#8212;Referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs and ordered to be
printed</p>
<opener>
<salute>To the House of Representatives:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I return herewith, without my approval, enrolled H. R. 5918, which would amend Public Law No. 96 of the Seventy-fifth Congress, being an act entitled "An act amending section 2 of Public Law No. 716 of the Seventy-fourth Congress, being an act entitled 'An act to relieve restricted Indians whose lands have been taxed or have been lost by failure to pay taxes and for other purposes'."</p>
<p>The effect of this act, if approved, would be to subject to taxation by State, county, and municipal authorities from and after June 6, 1936, certain Indian lands that were made tax exempt by the act of June 20, 1936 (49 <title>Stat.</title> 1542), and which continued in that status until the passage of the act of May 19, 1937 (50 <title>Stat.</title> 188). It appears that the scope of the act of June 20, 1936, supra, developed to be greater than the Congress originally intended, and that the tax exemption granted thereby was subsequently limited by the passage of the act of May 19, 1937, supra, to lands falling within two specified classes. In the interim, however, certain lands which were subjected to taxation by the act last cited enjoyed freedom from taxation.</p><pb n="2" />
<fw> 2	RESTRICTED INDIANS </fw>
<p>In my opinion, it would be unjust at this late date to place the owners of the affected lands in the position of having to pay taxes for a period during which they had every right to believe that no such obligation would accrue against them. To impose this burden upon them now might result in undue hardship in some cases if not in the actual loss of their lands through tax sales.</p>
<p>I do not discuss the question of the constitutionality of this retroactive enactment, but it is one worthy of serious consideration.</p>
