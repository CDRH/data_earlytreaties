<p>The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to investigate and decide claims of individual members of the Stockbridge and Munsee Tribe but is not clear as to just what individuals would be authorized to file claims, the exact nature thereof, or the amount involved. The only individual claims which have been brought forward are those of persons who claimed to be members of the Stock-bridge and Munsee Tribe of Indians but whose claims were disallowed when the rolls of the tribe were prepared.</p>

<head>THE LATE CHARLES V. TRUAX</head>
<p>Mr. DUFFEY of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio?</p>
<p>There was no objection.</p>
<p>Mr. DUFFEY of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, again the House of Representatives of the Seventy-fourth Congress of the United States pauses to pay a tribute of respect and esteem to a deceased colleague. In my own behalf and for colleagues from Ohio, on both sides of the aisle, I bring to the official attention of the House of Representatives the sad statement of the death of Hon. CHARLES V. TRUAX, Congressman at large, from Ohio.</p>
<p>Shortly after 1 o'clock on last Friday, August 9, 1935, he left the floor of the House, feeling somewhat ill. He did not realize that he was never to return, for within a few short hours thereafter his death occurred. It was sudden and unexpected.</p>
<p>There is not a Member of the House who did not know the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. TRUAX. He was always present when the House was in session, zealously and sincerely entering into debate, and with a colorful presentation of his viewpoint. He worked arduously and valiantly in the interest of the common people&#8212;in the interest of the farmer and the veteran and laborer. He fought vigorously against what he was wont to call "big business" and "monopolistic tendencies." His last words on the floor of the House were typical of the gentleman from Ohio, reflecting his intense interest in the problem of the farmer, when we read on page 12819 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of August 9, 1935, his inquiry in these words:</p>
<p>Mr. TRUAX. Does not the gentleman believe that it does not make any difference how high the price of hogs or how high the price of cattle, when a particular farmer loses his farm he is out for the balance of his life? There are a half million going to lose their farms because of the failure of this Congress to enact the Frazier-Lemke law.</p>
<p>And then, when we turn to page 12837 of the RECORD for the same date, on the quorum roll call no, 160, we read:</p> <quote>And the following Members failed to answer to their names: </quote>
<p>And among those absent appears the name "TRUAX." When roll calls hereafter are called Mr. TRUAX, of Ohio, will forever fail to answer to his name.</p>
<p>We from Ohio had learned to know Mr. TRUAx. His heart was warm and his sentiments and feelings were sympathetic and friendly.</p>
<p>Congressman CHARLES V. TRUAX, Democrat, of Bucyrus, Ohio, 49 years of age, was born on a farm and educated in the country and public schools. The farm was his home</p>
