<fw> 9682	CONGRESSIONAL RECORD HOUSE	AUGUST 21 </fw>
<head>UINTAH, WHITE RIVER, AND UNCOMPAHGRE BANDS OF UTE INDIANS'</head>
<p>H. R. 4399. I am withholding approval of H. R.4399,
authorizing an appropriation of $860,098.75 for payment to the Uintah, White River, and Uncompahgre Bands of Ute Indians for 36,223 acres of land, comprising a portion of a total area of 1,010,000 acres ceded to the Government by the Ute Indians and added to the Uintah National Forest in 1905. The Indians have been compensated for 973,777 acres of this ceded land, at $1.25 per acre, in the amount of $1,217,221.25, under the act of February 13, 1931.</p>
<p>As to the area of 36,223 acres, which contains certain deposits of coal, that act directed the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain the value thereof and report his findings to Congress; and in accordance therewith the Secretary reported to Congress on July 20, 1931, that the value of this area, as appraised by the United States Geological Survey, was $62,165.75.</p>
<p>The amount of compensation proposed in the pending bill is the amount of an appraisal made in 1910, with respect to which the Director of the Geological Survey, in a letter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs on January 21, 1937, states, in part, as follows:</p>
<p>Such values represent, in fact, nothing more than the worth of the coal therein for purposes of immediate development. * * * As they were designed to prevent the speculative purchase and withholding from development of Federally owned coal lands, those values represent present worth only as of the date commercial development of the coal involved becomes commercially feasible. For the coal acreage here involved such date has not yet arrived and was even more remote in 1905 than at present. It is, in fact, still so far in the future as to be subject only to conjecture, with some room for doubt that it will ever arrive. * * * For the administrative purpose for which they were made, the valuations placed upon the coal acreage on the basis of Lupton's findings (appraisal of 1910) are fair and reasonable, though they are exorbitant and excessive to the point of ab, surdity as a measure of the present worth of the coal rights involved to the Federal Government or to any other possible purchaser.</p>
<p>After careful consideration of the record in this case, I am unable to reach the conclusion that the payment authorized by this bill is justified.</p>
<head>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. KLAMATH BUSINESS COMMITTEE AND OFFICIAL DELEGATES</head>
<p>H. R. 5975 authorizes the establishment of per-diem payments in lieu of compensation and expenses for members of the Klamath business committee and official Klamath delegates to Washington.</p>
<p>The legislation is objectionable because (a) the amount to be expended in any one year is unlimited; (b) there is no restriction on the number of delegates to be chosen to represent the tribe in Washington at any one time; (c) representatives of the tribe could visit Washington at will; and (d) the tribal representatives could stay in Washington for an unlimited period.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that tribal funds are involved, the Secretary of the Interior or the Commissioner of Indian Affairs should have authority to determine the size of a delegation, and to limit the visit to a period of time necessary to complete the business in hand. Without administrative control large sums of Klamath tribal funds could be wasted by maintaining a delegation at the seat of government at times when the presence of such a delegation is wholly unnecessary.</p>
<p>For these reasons I am withholding approval of H. R. 5975.</p>

<p>On September 2, 1937:</p>
<head>WASHINGTON, D. C., AIRPORT</head>
<p>H. R. 7985. I am withholding approval of H. R. 7985, an act to provide for the enlargement of the so-called Washington-Hoover Airport because of the complete futility of the act.
I am compelled to do this with deep regret, because the failure to provide for an adequate airport may lead to serious accidents before one can be built.</p>
<p>This is a subject which has been studied, reported on, and discussed for years. The most recent study was by an air-port commission this year. Three Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives, and three members appointed by the President to study all possible air-field sites&#8212;48 in number&#8212;reduced this number to 8 for further study, then to 3, and finally recommended a permanent airport on high ground at Camp Springs, Md. The principal objection to the Camp Springs site was that it was 9 miles from the center of the hotel and business district. It was located, however, on high ground not subject to river fogs.</p>
<p>The second choice of this commission was the Gravelly Point site, where a field adequate in size could be built, principally by the pump-and-fill method, only a short distance south of the present airport. The principal objection to the Gravelly Point site was that it was on comparatively rare occasions subject to river fogs, an objection which applies almost equally <p>to the Washington-Hoover Airport.</p>
Only one member of the commission favored the Washington-Hoover Field, although the evidence against it from all the experts who appeared before the commission was very strong. The Washington-Hoover Field is subject to fogs and, under the proposed bill, even with a small addition of 53 acres taken from Department of Agriculture land, would still leave this field as one of the poorest fields in the entire Nation for large planes carrying passengers and mail. This is a simple fact.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bill provides for the closing of an important highway leading into the heart of the National Capital and for the lease of Government land for 50 years to a private corporation. The principal aviation field of the National Capital should not be owned or controlled by any private corporation.  This in itself is sufficient justification ,for disapproval of the bill.</p>
<p>It is my thought that because of  the importance of air traffic to and from the District of Columbia the Government of the United States could well afford two fields. After careful consideration I am of the belief that the. Gravelly Point site should be developed for use in all good weather when they are no river fogs or bad flying conditions. This site is within 10 minutes of the center of Washington. It could be used by the large transport planes on probably 80 percent of all flying days.</p>
<p>At the same time I believe that the Government should develop anf additional field on high land not subject to fogs. Such a field, either at Camp Springs or at some similar site, could be made ready in a very few months of work and would be used during the comparatively small number of days when the Gravelly Point site is unsafe because of river fogs.</p>
<p>I shall ask the Congress, immediately upon their reconvening, to take up this matter as quickly as possible. Further, I am asking the Secretary of Commerce, until such time as a high, level field can be made available, to close the Washington-Hoover Airport to all planes whenever, in the judgment of the Bureau of Air Commerce, landing on or taking off from that field is unsafe. </p>
<p>If the Congress provides for a high, level field in .the early part of its next session, there is no reason why such a field cannot be made available, at least for emergency use, within a comparatively short time.</p>
<p>Such a field, however, would of necessity be 9 or 10 miles from the center of the District, and I hope that the Congress will also see fit to develop the Gravelly Point site, which would, of course, require 2 or 3 years to complete.</p>
