The nature of the guardianship and control over the Indians, exercised by me as Secretary and trustee, is such as to require this Department to keep an account of the funds to their credit or held in trust for them, and to receive the interest on their trust-funds promptly when due.

<p>Mr. RANDALL. I move that the message and accompanying documents be printed and referred to the Committee on Appropriations. I desire to say that the bill which has been returned by the President was reported from Committee on Appropriations at the suggestion of the Department of the Interior. A subcommittee of that committee, as I understand, waited upon the Secretary of the Interior, who suggested an amendment thereto, which was incorporated in the bill as passed.</p>
<p>Mr. GARFIELD. Lot it be referred to the Committee on Appropriations, and they can examine and report upon it.</p>
<p>Mr. RANDALL. I only meant to place the committee right.</p>
<p>Mr. GARFIELD. If it has been ascertained that there is some inaccuracy of expression in the bill&#8212;</p>
<p>Mr. RANDALL. It is a very strange thing that we should pass a bill at the instance of the Department, and that very Department should cause it to be vetoed.</p>
<p>Mr. HOLMAN. A bill prepared at the instance of the Department itself?</p>
<p>Mr. RANDALL. Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. GARFIELD. Let it go to the committee.</p>
<p>Mr. RANDALL. That is my motion.</p>
<p>The motion of Mr. RANDALL was then agreed to.</p>
  </div1>

<head>LEAVE OF ABSENCE.</head>
<p>Mr. Davis was granted leave of absence for five days, on account of important business.
Mr. WELLS, of Mississippi, was granted leave of absence from the 4th to the 16th instant.
Mr. HOLMAN. I move that the House now adjourn.</p>
<p>The motion was agreed to; and accordingly (at four o'clock and thirty minutes p. m.) the House adjourned.</p>
