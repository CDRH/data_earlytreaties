<head>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</head>
<p>In re bills presented to the President less than ten days before the adjournment of Congress and not signed by him. In the case of each such bill, what was done with the engrossed copy of the bill, and what communication or memorandum was made in connection with such disposition?</p>
Such unsigned bills are found in four places: in the custody of the Secretary of the Senate; in the custody of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress (where Presidential messages to the House of Representatives prior to the Civil War have been deposited); in the
R<p>S. 305&#8212;stamped received at the Executive Mansion Feb. 23, 1895. On an attached typewritten memorandum is penciled in the President's handwriting:</p>
<p>Soldier's application for pension under general disability laws was rejected on ground injury not result of service. Widow's claim now pending and awaiting proof. Entitled under law of 1890 but no proof of his death.</p>
<p>Senate bills 333, 707, 1009, 1066 have no dates of receipt stamped on them and no marks by President on bills or attached papers.</p>
<p>S. 1189 is stamped as received Mar. 2, 1895. S. 1252 is undated. So is S. 1483. On an attached committee report is penciled in President's handwriting, "Hold."</p>
<p>S. 1535 is stamped Mar. 1. On an attached letter from the Secretary of the Navy the President has penciled this unsigned memorandum:</p>
<quote>
I do not see why the records of the Navy should state that this doctor was honorably discharged for the evident purpose of giving him a pension to which he is not entitled. There seems to have been no excuse for his desertion and he says himself he would not have complained of the harshness of his punishment if he had not lost his fingers in 1866.</quote>
<p>S. 1639 and S. 1692 are stamped as received Mar. 2. On a committee report attached to the latter the President penciled:</p><quote>
Not in the service and no satisfactory proof that his present condition has any relation to his employment in aid of military operations 30 years ago.</quote>
<p>No dates of receipt are stamped on the following bills: S. 2362; S. 2721; H. R. 995; H. R. 1310; H. R. 4162; H. R. 4704; H. R. 6565; H. R. 6816; H. R. 6831; H. R. 7603; H. R. 7645; H. R. 8659; H. R. 8873.</p>
<p>S. 2243 is stamped as received Feb. 28; S. 2351, Mar. 1; S. 2275, S. 2364, S. 2799 and H. R. 684, Mar. 2. Attached to H. R. 684 is a committee report on which the President penciled:</p>
<quote>
This bill is not in the form recommended by the Senate Comm. I don't think there is much merit in it in any view.</quote>
<p>H. R. 840 was received Mar. 2. On an attached report the President penciled:</p>
<p>He w'd be 2d Lieut. from Aug 29, 1863, to June 14, 1864.</p>
<p>H. R. 3150 and H. R. 4479 were stamped as received Feb. 27; H. R. 952, H. R. 1581, H. R. 1819, H. R. 2130, H. R. 3128, H. R. 3147, H. R. 3194, H. R. 4724 were stamped as received Mar. 2.</p>
<p>H. R. 4935&#8212;received Feb. 27. On attached typewritten memo-randum the President penciled:</p>
<quote>Pension was granted to widow Sept. 10, 1892. </quote>
<p>It is now alleged that she married Aug 1 or Aug. 6 (See report) 1892.</p>
<p>There is no proof that her pension has been stopped. How could it have been granted to her after her marriage?</p>
<p>H. R. 5062&#8212;received Mar. 1. On attached report the President penciled:</p>
<quote>
<p>1. No approval of route by Secretary of Interior.</p>
<p>2. Courts of Texas, Arkansas & Kansas given jurisdiction of controversies. (Courts in Indian Territory are soon to be organized.)</p>
<p>3. No consent of Indians to be obtained except as to allottees.</p>
<p>H. R. 5224, is stamped as received Feb. 23, 1895. H. R. 7259 was received Feb. 27.</p>
