VETO OF ACT PROVIDING SPECIAL RETIREMENT
BENEFITS TO CERTAIN NON-INDIAN EMPLOYEES
OF THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND THE
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE
MESSAGE

FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
VETOING
H.R. 5465, AN ACT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE WHO ARE NOT ENTITLED TO INDIAN PREFERENCE, TO PRO-VIDE GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVANCEMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OF INDIANS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
SEPTEMBER 27, 1976.-Message and accompanying act referred to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and ordered to be printed


U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 57-011 0	WASHINGTON : 1976
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning, without my approval, H.R. 5465, a bill which would provide special retirement benefits to certain non-Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) who are adversely affected by Indian preference. requirements.
I strongly support the objective of having Indians administer the Federal programs directly affecting them. I am familiar with and understand the concern of non-Indian employees of these agencies about their long-term career prospects because of Indian preference. But H.R. 5465 is the wrong way to deal with this problem.
This bill is designed to increase employment opportunities for Indians by providing special compensation to non-Indian employees in BIA and IHS who retire early. It seeks to accomplish this purpose by authorizing payment of extraordinary retirement benefits under certain conditions to non-Indian employees of these agencies who re-tire before 1986-benefits more liberal than those available to any other group of Federal employees under the civil service retirement system. I believe that this approach will result in inequities and added costs that far exceed the problem it is attempting to solve-a problem which is already being addressed through administrative actions by the agencies involved.
H.R. 5465 would provide windfall retirement benefits to a relatively small number of the non-Indian employees of these agencies. The Indian employees and other non-Indian employees in these same agencies would not receive these benefits. The eligible employees are not in danger of losing their jobs. Because they may face a limited outlook for promotion, the bill would pay these employees costly annuities even though they had completed substantially less than a full career. Payments could be made at age 50 after only 20 years of Federal service, of which as little as 11 years need be Indian-agency service. Their annuities would be equivalent to the benefits it would take the average Federal employee until age 60 and 27 years of service to earn.
This would seriously distort and misuse the retirement system to solve a problem of personnel management for which there are far more appropriate administrative solutions. The Departments of the Interior and Health, Education, and Welfare have established special placement programs to help non-Indian employees who desire other jobs. I am asking the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make certain that those placement efforts are rigorously pursued with all agencies of the Federal Government.
Further, these Departments assure me that many non-Indian employees continue to have ample opportunity for full careers with Indian agencies if they so desire. Accordingly, H.R. 5465 represents an excessive, although well-motivated, reaction to the situation. Indian preference does pose a problem in these agencies, but it can and should be redressed without resort to costly retirement benefits.
I am not prepared, therefore, to accept the discriminatory and costly approach of H.R. 5465.

ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE-VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 94-624)

To the House of Representatives:

This bill is designed to increase employment opportunities for Indians by providing special compensation to non-Indian employees in BIA and IRS who retire early. It seeks to accomplish this purpose by authorizing payment of extraordinary retirement benefits under certain conditions to non-Indian employees of these agencies who retire before 1986—benefits more liberal than those available to any other group of Federal employees under the civil service retirement system. I believe that this approach will result in inequities and added costs that far exceed the problem it is attempting to solve—a problem which is already being addressed through administrative actions by the agencies involved.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE
CLERK OF THE HOUSE
The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:
WASHINGTON, D.C.,
September 27, 1976. Hon CARL ALBERT,
The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.
DEAR MR. SPEAKER: I have the honor to transmit herewith a sealed envelope from the White House, received in the Clerk's Office at 7:30 P.M. on Friday, September 24, 1976, and said to contain a message from the President wherein he transmits H.R. 13655, An Act to establish a five-year re-search and development program leading to advanced automobile propulsion systems, and for other purposes, and a veto message thereon.
With kind regards, I am,
Sincerely,
EDMUND L. HENSHAw, Jr., Clerk, House of Representatives.
AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORT RE-SEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1976—VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 94-625)
The SPEAKER laid before the House the following veto message from the President of the United States :
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning, without my approval, H.R. 13655, the "Automotive Transport Research and Development Act of 1976."
This bill would establish a five-year research and development program with-in the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) leading to the development of advanced automobile propulsion systems, advanced automobilesubsystems, and integrated test vehicles to promote the development of advanced alternatives to existing automobiles. The major objective of the program would be the development and construction of integrated test vehicles which would incorporate advanced automobile engines into complete vehicles conforming to Federal requirements for safety, emissions, damageability, and fuel economy. Such development would unnecessarily duplicate existing authorities and extend into areas private industry is best equipped to pursue.
Both ERDA and the Department of Transportation (DOT) , the two Federal agencies which would be most directly affected by this program, already have sufficient authority to accomplish the objectives of this bill. Under the authority of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and the Federal Non-nuclear Energy Re-search and Development Act of 1974, ERDA's Highway Vehicle Systems Pro-gram is presently proceeding with the development of new automobile engine systems to the point where several prototype systems can be demonstrated in vehicles on the road. Under my fiscal year 1977 budget, ERDA will continue to emphasize the development of such advanced engines designed to meet higher levels of fuel economy and lower emissions.
Ongoing DOT programs under the authority of the Department of Transportation * Act, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, and the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act are currently sponsoring advanced automobile' research that, except for advanced automobile engines, will achieve the purposes of this bill. Detailed design development for two versions of a Research Safety Vehicle should be completed before the end of this year. Under my fiscal year 1977 budget, DOT will have sufficient funds for its advanced automobile research and development activities.
The Federal government, through ERDA and DOT, can play an important role in exploring the research areas that must be developed before advanced auto-mobiles are produced which meet the Nation's conservation goals-especially in the critical area of new engine re-search. However, it must be recognized that private industry has substantial expertise and interest in the development and production of advanced automobiles.
