<p>I return herewith without my approval H. R. 2199, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to issue a patent in fee to Henry Big Day and other heirs of Catherine Shield Chief, deceased, to certain lands on the Crow Indian Reservation.</p>
<p>This bill appears to have been passed under a misapprehension as to what its effect would be if enacted. The legislative history indicates that it was understood as being a bill that would authorize the Indian owners of certain property, held in trust for them by the Unite l States, to sell that property, subject to the supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In particular, the committee reports state that&#8212;</p>
<p>title will ultimately pass to Mr. Kopak either in exchange for an equitable amount of other land, to be appraised by officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or for cash, whichever proves of greater benefit to the heirs of Catherine Shield Chief, as determined by the Bureau.</p>
<p>If this were the effect of the bill, it would have simply restated existing laws, since general authority for the sale, under supervision, of trust or restricted Indian property is contained in the act of June 25,<pb n="2" />
<fw> *
2	PATENT IN FEE TO HENRY BIG DAY AND OTHERS </fw>
1910 (36 <title>Stat.</title> 855, 25 U. S. C. sec. 372), as amended, and other statutes. While unnecessary, such repetitive legislation would not have been objectionable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the actual effect of the bill is to make mandatory the issuance of a patent in fee for the land involved. Such a patent would discharge the property from all restrictions, and would eliminate the safeguards which existing laws afford the Indians against shortsightedness on their own part or overreaching on the part of others. Particularly in the situation here involved, I believe it would be most unwise to abrogate these safeguards.</p>
<p>The record indicates that a prospective purchaser of the land, rather than the Indian owners, is the moving party for the sale. The owners have not been found competent to manage their business affairs, as required for the issuance of a patent in fee under the general law, nor is it clear that all or a majority of them desire to receive such a patent. Some of the owners are minors and, assuming a sale of the land would be to their best interests, the issuance of a patent in fee might hinder, rather than facilitate, the proposed sale by necessitating, for conveyance of their shares, court proceedings that would not be requisite in the case of a sale under supervision pursuant to the applicable statutes.</p>
<p>Finally, approval of this bill might result in the Indians being forced to accept whatever price is offered them for the land in order to avoid losing it through tax sale, since issuance of a patent in fee would terminate the present tax exemption.</p>
<p>A patent in fee should not be forced on an Indian who does not want one, and Indian property should not be sold in disregard of Indian interests. Under existing laws the land covered by this bid may be sold or partitioned for the benefit of the Indian owners upon application by them, provided their interests or those of their tribe would not be prejudiced thereby. I believe the procedures established by these laws are sound, and that the land problem sought to be met by the bill before me can be resolved justly and fairly by resort to those procedures.</p>
<p>In all the circumstances, I am constrained to withhold my approval from H. R. 2199.</p>

<fw> 1947	CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE	5489 </fw>
<p>understanding and remembrance on them often. It is not difficult for us to remember them in kindness and charity for we can say with Longfellow:</p>
<p>We may build more splendid habitations, fill our rooms with paintings and with sculptures, but we cannot buy with gold the old associations.</p>
<p>Words cannot express how much they will be missed by family and friends. It is not in the power of man to know the influence of another man's life. To each is given specific talents and graces and thought processes, which go to make up his personality and make him unique among his associates. Each deed he per-forms in his very own and has its influence where not even he sometimes knows. As we glance back in memory at the faces of former Congresses we remember one man for his deeds and great words of courage, another for his intense devotion to the duties of his office, another for his skill in debate; and still another for his high integrity and moral purpose. We may miss a friend for something as simple as a cheering smile, a word of encouragement, the greater wordless depth of his understanding. We will miss the pleasure of still another's hearty handshake, buoyancy, and love of life. The man whose little hidden kindly deeds that were known but to us alone, we shall miss most of all.</p>
<p>When we consider the traits of personality and character which endeared our departed friends to us, we should pause to weigh how many opportunities for fellowship and understanding elude us who are left because we are engrossed in our own particular spheres of duty. We are often too busy with our usual workaday lives to enlarge our understanding and to enrich our own characters by wholeheartedly giving of ourselves in sincere friendship. Here in this Congress sit men from every State and Territory in our grand old Union. From the forests of Washington, and Maine, and Oregon; from California's sunny clime; from Kansas' waving plains and Mississippi's cotton fields; from New York's man-made canyons and my own Montana's shining mountains; come our colaborers with the wealth of their knowledge. Here we can exchange information about commerce and industry and agriculture and mining. We can have first-hand in-formation about these from those who know them best&#8212;for you who sit here represent these infinite and various fields that make up the vast panorama that is America. As we stand here in recollection of our former colleagues, maybe wistfully wishing that we had taken time in one case to lend a helping hand or in another to say a word of praise, let us resolve that we will not fail to cement the bonds of friendship offered here now.</p>
<p>At this hour of remembrance we like to remember our comrades as men who, coming to this great legislative body, were moved with the desire to be of service to their fellow citizens. They assumed obligations not alone because of the personal benefits to be derived, but because of the contributions they felt they could give to the welfare of their community, State, and Nation. As legislators it was their constant duty toanswer their country's needs, and in so doing, they tried to keep alive in this land the principles of peace, freedom, and equality. Yes, this. is the way we think of them. We can say that it was their hourly care, as men and Americans, "to do that which their hands findeth to do with carefulness, unaffected dignity, humanity, freedom, and justice." Each of these departed ones labored to make this a better, a more abundant, and a more beautiful world. Their good deeds live after them. Each act of kindness, of humanity, of courage, of wisdom, of justice which they performed somehow makes less burdensome our present task of taking up their work where they left off. Good never dies. It permeates our present and makes possible our future. Let us therefore take pride in the lofty endeavors of our departed colleagues and keep their memory fresh by carrying on their ideals.</p>
<p>I can think of no better way to show our respect to our dead or our duty to ourselves and to the future citizens of our country than to live up to the ideals of charity, justice, fidelity, and democracy which motivated the Iives of these departed Members being honored today. It seems to me that the very foundation of our lives and Nation depends on the practice of such ideals. Today with our democracy being threatened on all sides, it is imperative that we live in bonds of closer understanding and unanimity. We should adhere to the precepts that actuated them as good Americans: to be democratic in our daily lives, to live and let live, to practice charity and tolerance, to allow free speech, the practice of one's own religion, and freedom of organization and assembly. They lived for democracy, fought for it, each in his own way, and practiced it so that we who re-main behind can continue in the rights and privileges which they loved so much and treasured so dearly. Their heritage to us is something which we shall forever cherish because it is our connection with them. They served during difficult times. They met the problems confronting them with courage and fortitude, thus giving us hope that we may solve those that now face us&#8212;internal troubles which will take our greatest efforts, and external ones which make us apprehensive. They fought vigorously and fervently for peace, and now they have that peace which surpasses all understanding. We feel therefore, that they can, from that eternal land to which they have gone but where they still live, inspire us to carry on their work for peace on earth and good will among men.</p>
<p>They gave their lives as truly as any soldier on the field of battle and they exemplified in their persons that duty to God and country so characteristic of the membership of this great. body. In the words of the Poet, Joyce Kilmer, I should like to greet the departed ones:</p>
<lg type="">
<l>Farewell!</l>
<l>Comrades true, born anew, peace to you!</l><l> Your souls shall be where the heroes are</l> <l>And your memory shine like the morning
star.</l>
<l>Brave and dear,</l>
<l>Shield us here.</l>
<l>Farewell!</l>

<head>NATIONAL HEALTH AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAMS—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 261)</head>
<p>The SPEAKER laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States which was read and referred to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and ordered to be printed:</p>

<opener>
<salute>To the Congress of the United States:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Healthy citizens constitute our greatest national resource. In time of peace, as in time of war, our ultimate strength stems from the vigor of our people. The welfare and security of our Nation demand that the opportunity for good health be made available to all, regardless of residence, race, or economic status.</p>
<p>At no time can we afford to lose the productive energies and capacities of millions of our citizens. Nor can we permit our children to grow up without a fair chance of survival and a fair chance for a healthy life. We must not permit our rural families to suffer for lack of physicians, dentists, nurses, and hospitals. We must not reserve a chance for good health and a long productive life to the well-to-do alone. A great and free nation should bring good health care within the reach of all its people.</p>
<p>In my message to the Congress on November 19, 1945, I said that every American should have the right to adequate medical care and to adequate protection from the economic threat of sickness. To provide this care and protection is a challenging task, requiring action on a wide front.</p>
<p>I have previously outlined the long-range health program which I consider necessary to the national welfare and security. I say again that such a program must include:</p>
<p>1. Adequate public-health services, including an expanded maternal&#8211;and child&#8211;health program.</p>
<p>2. Additional medical research and medical education.</p>
<p>3. More hospitals and more doctors&#8212;in all areas of the country where they are needed.</p>
<p>4. Insurance against the costs of medical care.</p>
<p>5. Protection against loss of earnings during illness.</p>
<p>I am pleased to observe that important advances were made by the last Congress toward realization of some of the goals which I set forth in my earlier message. But we must not rest until we have achieved all our objectives. I urge this
Congress to enact additional legislation to authorize the program I have outlined, even though the fulfillment of some aspects of it may take time.</p>
<p>Our public-health services&#8212;Federal, State, and local&#8212;provide our greatest and most successful defense against preventable diseases. But in many States, cities, and counties in America, limited funds reduce the work of our public-health services to a dangerously inadequate level. Public services related to maternal and child health were expanded by the Seventy-ninth Congress, through amendments to the Social Security Act. This action was gratifying, but the long-range need for additional health services for children and expectant mothers, and for care of crippled or otherwise physically handicapped children, should be carefully studied by the Congress.</p>
<p>The Nation's medical-research programs must in the future be expanded so that we can learn more about the prevention and cure of disease. The Congress has already recognized this by providing for research into the causes of cancer and mental diseases and abnormalities. Further dividends will accrue to our Nation&#8212;and to our people&#8212;if research can point the way toward combating and overcoming such major illnesses as arthritis and rheumatic fever, and diseases of the heart, kidneys, and arteries.</p>
<p>We still face a shortage of hospitals, physicians, dentists, and nurses. Those we have are unfairly distributed. The shortage of doctors, dentists, and nurses can be met only through expanded educational opportunities. The shortage of hospitals will be met in part through the action of the last Congress which provided Federal aid for the construction of hospitals.</p>
<p>In the last analysis the patient's ability to pay for the services of physicians or dentists, or for hospital care, determines the distribution of doctors and the location of hospitals. Few doctors can be expected to practice today in sparsely settled areas or where prospective patients are unable to pay for their services. Doctors tend to concentrate in communities where hospitals and other facilities are best and where their incomes are most secure. The unequal distribution of doctors and hospitals will plague this Nation until means are found to finance modern medical care for all of our people.</p>
<p>National health insurance is the most effective single way to meet the Nation's health needs. Because adequate treatment of many illnesses is expensive and its cost cannot be anticipated by the individual, many persons are forced to go without needed medical attention. Children do not receive adequate medical and dental care. Symptoms which should come early to the attention of a physician are often ignored until too late. The poor are not the only ones who "cannot afford adequate medical care. The truth is that all except the rich may at some time be struck by illness which requires care and services they cannot afford. Countless families who are entirely self-supporting in every</p>

<p>friends advised me to go to the dentist. So I went to the dentist and opened my mouth and he told me&#8212;I am 33 now and have no cavities in my mouth. He told me he would have to pull four wisdom teeth out. I said why were they dead? He said 'No, no, but they might give you trouble in the future.'</p>
<p>"So I gave him $10 for telling me this. I never went from that time to this. I will go when I have real trouble. I never appreciated the life in Russia until I live here. Here you have to work hard in order to live, use all your courage not to die." [Applause.]</p>
<p>(Mr. Danowsky announces a period of questioning will follow:)</p>
<p>Question (by a young, red-haired girl). "How does the ruble compare with the American dollar?"</p>
<p>Answer. "Officially $1 costs 5 rubles. But diplomatics get 12 rubles."</p>
<p>Question (by a young man in khaki clothes). "If Russia really wants world peace why doesn't she allow us to see what resources she has?"</p>
<p>Answer. "A very interesting question. This question bothers me and the whole world. The Russian people always desire and need peace. I read both languages, Russian and English. I read all the papers here and occasionally I go 'to the Library of Congress and read all papers printed IN Moscow. It is very interesting, .and when I read these papers always you can see here evidence of press where people talk all the time about having a war, to throw the atomic bomb on Russia, to destroy because they have a system which is very prideful. At the present time Russians are busy to restore all those houses, all those cities, all those towns. Russian people make streets, plants, produce new style of shoes, new fashion of dress, new production, and never they talk about having a war. If you read the papers about 2 or 3 days ago, it was printed in the Washington Post an interview of Stalin with Stamen and Stalin said in spite of the fact that so great countries have different system they can and are able to cooperate and live peacefully because it is a desire of the people."</p>
<p>Question. "Does Russia's system of free hospitalization compare with our free clinics for the poor?"</p>
