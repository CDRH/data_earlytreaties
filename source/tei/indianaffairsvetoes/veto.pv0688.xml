<hi rend="italic">To the House of Representatives:</hi>
</opener>
<p>I return herewith without approval House bill number 8165, entitled "An act authorizing the Kansas City, Oklahoma and Pacific Railway
Company to construct and operate a railway through Indian reservations in the Indian Territory and the Territories of Oklahoma and New Mexico, and for other purposes."
This bill contains concessions more comprehensive and sweeping than any ever presented for my approval, and it seems to me the rights and interests of the Indians and the Government are the least protected.</p>
<p>The route apparently desired, though passing through or into one State and three Territories, is described as indefinitely as possible, and does not seem to be subject to the approval in its entirety of the Secretary of the Interior or any other governmental agency having relation to the interest involved.</p>
<p>There is no provision for obtaining the consent of the Indians through whose territory and reservations the rail may be located.</p>
<p>Though it is proposed to build the railroad through Territories having local courts convenient to their inhabitants, all controversies that may arise out of the location and building of the road are by the provisions of the bill to be passed upon by the United States circuit and district courts for the district of Kansas, "and such other courts as may be authorized by Congress."</p>
<p>The bill provides that "the civil jurisdiction of said courts is hereby extended within the limits of said Indian reservations without distinction as to citizenship of the parties, so far as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act?' This provision permits the subordination of the jurisdiction of Indian courts, which we are bound by treaty to protect, to the "provisions of this act" and to the interests and pref<pb n="2" />
<fw> C) KANSAS CITY. OKLAHOMA A-I'M PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY. </fw>
erences of the railroad company for whose benefit the bill under consideration is intended.</p>
<p>A plan of appraisal is provided for in the bill in case an agreement can not be reached as to the amount of compensation to be paid for the taking of lands held by individual occupants according to the laws, customs, and usages of any of the Indian nations or tribes, or by allotment or agreement with the Indians. It is, however, further provided that in case either party is dissatisfied with the award of the referees to be appointed an appeal may be taken to the district court held at Wichita, Kans., no matter where on the proposed route of the road the controversy may originate. If upon the hearing of said appeal the judgment of the court shall be for the same sum as the award of the referees, the costs shall be adjudged against the appellant, and if said judgment shall be for a smaller sum the costs shall be adjudged against the party claiming damages. It does not seem to me that the interests of an Indian occupant or allottee is properly regarded when he is obliged, if dissatisfied with an award for the taking of his laud, to go to the district court of Kansas for redress, at the risk of incurring costs and expenses that may not only exceed the award originally made to him, but leave him in debt.</p>
<p>It is probable that there are other valid objections to this bill. I have only attempted to suggest enough to justify my action in disapproving it.</p>
<p>In constructing legislation of this description it should not be forgotten that the rights and interests of the Indians are important in every view and should be scrupulously protected.</p>

<hi rend="italic"><p>An act authorizing the Kansas City, Oklahoma and Pacific Railway Company to construct and operate a railway through Indian reservations in the Indian Territory, and the Territories of Oklahoma and New Mexico, and for other purposes.</p></hi>
<p><hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</hi> That the Kansas City, Oklahoma and Pacific Railway Company, a corporation created under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas, be, and the same is hereby, authorized and invested and empowered with the right of locating, constructing, owning, equipping, and operating, using, and maintaining a rail way and telegraph and telephone line through all Indian reservations in the Indian.

every ten miles of road, with right to use such additional grounds where there are
heavy cuts or fills, not exceeding one hundred feet in width, as may be necessary for the construction and maintenance of said right of way, or so much thereof as may be included in said cuts or fills: Prorided, That no more than said addition of land shall be taken for any one station: Prorided sold That no part of said lands herein authorized to be taken shall be leased or sold by further, company; and they shall not be used except in such manner and for such purposes only as shall be necessary for the construction and convenient operation of said railroad, telegraph, and telephone lines; and when any portion thereof shall cease to be so used, such portion shall revert to the nation or tribe of Indians, or individual Indians, from which the same shall have been taken.</p>
<p>SEC. 3. That before said railway shall be constructed through any lands held by individual occupants, according to the laws, customs, and usages of any of the Indian nations or tribes through which it may be constructed, or by allotment under any laws of the United States or agreement with the Indians, full compensation shall be made to such occupants for all property to be taken or damages done by reason of the construction of such railway. In case of failure to make amicable settlement with any occupant such compensation shall be determined by the appraisement of three disinterested persons or referees, to be appointed, one, who shall act as chairman, by the President, one by the chief of the nation to which said occupant belongs, or in case of an allottee, by said allottee, or by his duly authorized guardian or legal representative, and one by said railway company, who, before entering upon the duties of their appointment, shall take and subscribe, before a district judge, clerk of the district court, or United States commissioner, an oath that they will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of their appointment, which oath, duly certified, shall be returned with their award to and filed with the Secretary of the Interior within sixty days from the completion thereof; and a majority of said referees shall be competent to act in case of the absence of a member after due notice; and upon the failure of either party to make such appointment within thirty days after the appointment made by the President the vacancy shall be filled by the district judge of the court held at Wichita, Kansas, upon the application of the other party. The chairman of said board shall appoint the time and place for all hearings within the nation to which the occupant belongs. Each of said referees shall receive for his services the sum of four dollars per day for each and every day they are engaged in the trial of any case submitted to them under this Act, with mileage of five cents per mile. Witnesses shall be allowed the usual fees allowed by the courts of said nation. The costs, including the compensation of the referees, shall be made a part of the award, and to be paid by said railway company. In case the referees can not agree. then two of them are authorized to make the award. Either party being dissatisfied with the findings of the referees shall have the right, within ninety days after the making of the award and notice of the same, to appeal by original petition to the district court held at Wichita, Kansas, which court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject-matter of said petition according to the laws of the State of Kansas providing for the determining of damages when property is taken for railway purposes. If, upon the hearing of said appeal, the judgment of the court shall be for a larger sum than the awards of the referees, the costs of said appeal shall be adjudged against the railway company. If the judgment of the court shall be for the same sum as the award of the referees, then the costs shall be adjudged against the appellant. If the judgment of the court shall be for a smaller sum than the award of the referees then the costs shall be adjudged against the party claiming damages. When proceedings have been commenced in court the railway company shall pay double the amount of the award into court to abide the judgment thereof, and then have the right to enter upon the property sought to be condemned and proceed with the construction of the railway.</p>
<p>SEC. 4. That said railway company shall not charge the inhabitants of said Territories a greater rate of freight than the rate authorized by the laws of the State of Kansas for services or transportation of the same kind: Provided, That the passenger rates shall not exceed three cents per mile. Congress hereby reserves the right to regulate the charges for freight and passengers on said railway, and of messages on said telegraph and telephone lines, until State governments are formed and shall exist in said Territories, within the limits of which said railway, or a part thereof, shall be located, and then such State government, or governments, shall be authorized to fix and regulate the cost of transportation of persons and freight within their respective limits by said railway; but Congress expressly reserves the right to fix and regulate at all times the cost of such transportation by said railway company whenever such transportation shall extend from one State into another, or shall extend into more than one State: Provided, That the rate of such transportation of passengers, local or interstate, shall not exceed the rate expressed: Provided farther, That said railway company shall carry the mail at such prices as Con ess may by law provide, and until such rate is fixed by law the Postmaster-General may fix the rate of compensation.</p>

<head>VETO MESSAGE&#8212;SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FLORISTS.</head>
<p>The SPEAKER laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read, referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and ordered to be printed:</p>
<opener>
<salute>To the House of Representatives:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I return herewith without approval House bill No. 5740, entitled An act incorporating the Society of American Florists."</p>
<p>No sufficient reason is apparent for the incorporation of this organization under Federal laws. There is not the least difficulty in the way of the accomplishment under State laws by the incorporators named in the bill of every purpose which can legitimately belong to their corporate existence. The creation of such a corporation by a special act of Congress establishes a vexatious and troublesome precedent.</p>
<p>There appears to be no limit in the bill to the value of the real and personal property which the proposed corporation may hold if acquired by donation or bequest. The limit of $50,000 applies only to property acquired by purchase.</p>
<p>A conclusive objection to the bill is found in the fact that it fails to carry out the purposes and objects of those interested in its passage. The promoters of the bill are florists who undoubtedly seek to advance floriculture. The declared object of the proposed incorporation is, however, stated in the bill to be " the elevation and advancement of horticulture in all its branches, to increase and diffuse the knowledge thereof, and for kindred purposes in the interest of horticulture."</p>
<p>It is entirely clear that the interests of florists would be badly served by a corporation confined to the furtherance of garden culture.</p>

This provision permits the subordination of the jurisdiction of Indian courts, which we are bound by treaty to protect, to the "provisions of this act" and to the interests and preferences of the railroad <p>company for whose benefit the bill under consideration is intended.</p>
A plan of appraisal is provided for in the bill in case an agreement can not be reached as to the amount of compensation to he paid for the taking of lands held by individual occupants according to the laws, customs, and usages of any of the Indian nations or tribes, or by allotment or agreement with the Indians. It is, however, further provided that in case either party is dissatisfied with the award of the referees to be appointed an appeal may be taken to the district court held at Wichita, Kans., no matter where on the proposed route of the road the controversy may originate. If upon the hearing of said appeal the judgment of the court shall be for the same sum as the award of the referees, the costs shall be adjudged against the appellant, and if said judgment shall be for a smaller sum the cost shall be adjudged against the party claiming damages. It does not seem to me that the interests of an Indian occupant or allottee is properly regarded when he is obliged, if dissatisfied with an award for the taking of his land, to go to the district court of Kansas for redress, at the risk of incurring costs and expenses that may not only exceed the award originally made to him, but leave him in debt.</p>
<p>It is probable that there are other valid objections to this bill. I have only attempted to suggest enough to justify my action in disapproving it.</p>
<p>In constructing legislation of this description it should not be forgotten that the rights and interests of the Indians are important in every view and should be scrupulously protected.</p>

<head>VETO MESSAGEâ€”HIRAM R. RHEA.</head>
<p>The SPEAKER also laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States, which was read:</p>
<quote>
<opener>
<hi rend="italic"><salute>To the House of Representatives:</salute></hi>
</opener>
<p>I return herewith without approval House bill No. 4555, entitled "An act granting a pension to Hiram R. Rhea and repealing an act approved March 3, 1871."</p>
<p>The person named in the title of this bill was pensioned under the provisions of a private not passed March 3, 1871. In 1892 a letter from the Commissioner of Pensions was presented to Congress exhibiting facts which established in a most satisfactory manner that the claim for pension allowed by said special act was a barefaced and impudent fraud, supported by deliberate perjury. This letter appears to be the moving cause of the passage of the bill now before me. Payment of pension under the fraudulent act has been suspended since January 28, 1803, and since that time no information has been received from the fraudulent pensioner.
The circumstances developed called for the repeal of the law of 1871 placing him upon the pension roll. This is accomplished. in the second section of the bill under consideration, which section I would be glad to approve. This re-peal, however, is accompanied by a provision in the first section of the bill directing the Secretary of the Interior to place upon the pension roll this identical fraudulent pensioner under a certificate numbered precisely the same as that heretofore issued to him " at a rate proportionate to the degree of disability from such gunshot wounds as may be shown to the satisfaction of said Secretary to have been received at the hands of Confederate soldiers or sympathizers while said Rhea was attempting to cooperate with the Union forces," etc.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the letter of the Commissioner of Pensions to which reference has been made, and which forms part of the committee's report on this bill is the basis of this repealing provision, and inasmuch as this letter furnishes evidence that the pensioner was, when injured, a very disreputable member of a band of armed rebels and was wounded by Union soldiers, I can not understand why the same bill, which for this reason purges the pension rolls of his name, should in the same breath undo this work and direct his name to be rewritten on the rolls.</p>
If the facts before Congress justify the repeal of the law under which this man fraudulently received a pension for nearly twenty-two years they certainly do not justify the provision directing his name to be put on the rolls again with a view to further examination of his case or for any other purpose.

<p>ROBERT BRIGHAM.</p>
<p>Mr. SIBLEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for the present consideration of the bill (H. R. 7000) for the relief of Robert Brigham, late postmaster at Franklin, Pa.</p>
<p>The bill was read, as follows:</p>
<p>Be it enacted, etc., That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and is hereby, authorized and directed to pay to Robert Brigham, late postmaster at Franklin, Pa., the sum of $2,666.93, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the same being amount lost through the failure of Venango National Bank, where such money was deposited by order of the Postmaster-General.</p>
<p>Mr. SAYERS. I should like to have some explanation of this bill. We want to know when this loss occurred.</p>
<p>The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman can make a short explanation.</p>
<p>Mr. SIBLEY. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Robert Brigham was appointed postmaster by President Lincoln, at a time when the post-office at
Franklin was a fourth-class post-office. Inside of a very few months, on account of the discovery and development of the petroleum fields of that Commonwealth, this post-office became the second or third office in the amount of business transacted in the State of
Pennsylvania. Mr. Brigham, at his own expense, fitted up the
office and put in boxes. At that time Mr. C. B. Culver, of the firm of Culver, Penn & Co., was a Representative in Congress. Another banker, Mr. Blakeley, was the bondsman of Mr. Brigham. Mr. Culver secured an order or presented an order to Mr. Brigham
from the Postmaster-General, which Major MCDOWELL, a member of the present House from Pennsylvania, who was at that time a clerk
in the office, saw and read, directing him to transfer his account
from the bank of Mr. Blakeley, who was his bondsman, to the
bank of Mr. Culver. Very soon thereafter Mr. Culver failed, the national bank failed, and Mr. Brigham lost his money. A fire which occurred afterwards destroyed all the fixtures that he had put in at his own expense. Mr. Brigham's bill was originally for $7,000.</p>
<p>Mr. MCDowELL, Mr. STONE, and myself agreed, all being residents of the town, that the money he had deposited under the order of the Postmaster-General should be paid to him and that we would unite in asking the House to reimburse him. This bill passed the Senate, but it failed to obtain consideration in the House. It has been before Congress for twenty years. It is another "Denman" case. This is a very small portion of the amount of money he lost. He went in there in affluent circumstances and was almost pauperized.</p>
