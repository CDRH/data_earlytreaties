<head>EXTENSION OF REMARKS</head>
<head type="sub">RESOLUTIONS REGARDING UNEMPLOYMENT IN ST. LOUIS, MO.
</head>
<p>Mr. COCHRAN of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, a resolution adopted by the Central Trades and Labor Union of St. Louis,
Mo., in reference to unemployment has just been brought to my attention. I have known that the unemployment situation in my home city has been serious, but I am rather alarmed by the conditions revealed in this resolution. I have been asked to call this matter to the attention of the Congress, and I therefore take the opportunity under leave to print granted me to incorporate the resolution as part of my remarks. I am personally acquainted with Mrs. Mary Ryder, William J. Fitzmaurice, W. G. Gibbons, and J. P. Altheide, who presented the resolution, and can assure you that before placing their names on any document they would be in possession of facts which would prevent anyone disputing their views.</p>
<p>My mail has clearly indicated that tells of thousands of our citizens are really in distress and unable to secure the necessities of life for their families, due to their inability to secure work.</p>	
<p>It seems to me the Congress of the United States should meet this situation before it reaches a more advanced stage. We have authorized the construction of and appropriated money for large building programs. If all the work contemplated by the Government was started at once, it would go a long way to alleviate those who the resolution state are not only suffering but are unwillingly idle.</p>
<p>Under this great public-building program hundreds of millions are at the disposal of the building commission. As an example of the delay in prosecuting this work, let me cite the condition in St. Louis. The Congress has authorized and appropriated the money for a new public building in St. Louis. The building commission agrees an emergency exists. This money was placed in their hands in May, 1928, and up to this time no agreement has been reached as to where the new building is to be located. When this new building is constructed, provided it is not placed on the present site. then the old Federal building will be sold and a modern building erected on that block of ground. The two projects will mean an expenditure of from twelve to fifteen million dollars. Surely the commission can advance no sound reason for not selecting a site. It is true there has been a difference of opinion as to where the new Government building should be located, but when Congress passed the present public building law it removed polities from the building program, and this commission should now decide, with the information it has at hand, where to place the building and start construction without further delay.</p>
<p>Then you have the hospital building program of the Veterans' Bureau. The projects have been authorized and millions appropriated to start immediate construction. It was last spring that these projects were assured by the action of Congress. Nevertheless, you find few buildings started, and in many in-stances the sites have not been chosen. There is no excuse for such delay. The Director of the Veterans' Bureau admits additional beds are needed in the district which includes St. Louis. Money has been set aside and is available to build an addition to the hospital at Excelsior Springs, Mo. Nearly a million is ready for this purpose. Are they spending it? No. They say it will be July, 1931, or after before that project is completed. Why not start it now? It is admitted it is needed, the money is available, and the proper legislation enacted.</p>
<p>The War Department is authorized to spend millions for improvements at Army hosts. This work should be started at once.</p>
<p>Rivers and harbors are to be improved. Flood-control work is to go on. Why not speed up the programs if a thorough investigation discloses the unemployment situation is as alarming as this resolution insists it is.</p>
<p>If every Member of Congress will make a survey in his district between now and the time the special session is called, information will be available from the entire country on unemployment. It is a problem that must be solved, and the Congress is in a position to solve it by speeding up projects already authorized and advancing additional funds for other work which has been agreed upon but not started.</p>
<p>The Government has an annual rental bill that is astonishing. Our Government is a permanent institution and there is no sound argument why it should not own the buildings it occupies for its agencies. Statistics will show that people who lease post-office buildings to the Government are permitted a rental paying anywhere from 15 to 22 per cent on their investment. While the contracts are for 10 years, there are specific provisions which enable the Government to secure a release any time it is desired. The Government can borrow money for as low as 4 per cent. Would it not be good business to pass legislation which would enable the Government to borrow a sufficient amount to construct buildings? The amount now being paid in rentals would be almost sufficient to pay the interest.</p>
