FROM


THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

RETURNING

WITHOUT APPROVAL, THE BILL (S. 18) ENTITLED "AN ACT AUTHORIZING PAYMENT TO THE SAN CARLOS APACHE INDIANS FOR THE LANDS CEDED BY THEM IN THE AGREEMENT OF FEBRUARY 25, 1896, RATIFIED BY THE ACT OF JUNE 10, 1896, AND REOPENING THE LANDS TO MINERAL ENTRY"</head>

on Indian Affairs, and ordered to be printed</head>

<salute>To the Senate:</salute>

<p>I return herewith, without my approval, S. 18, a bill authorizing payment to the San Carlos Apache Indians for the lands ceded by them in the agreement of February 25, 1896, ratified by the act of June 10, 1896, and reopening such lands to mineral entry.</p>
<p>The bill provides, by a declaration to that effect, for the payment to the San Carlos Apache Indians of $33,725 for 232,320 acres of land. It would appear, however, that this represents in reality a payment, at $1.25 per acre, for such ceded lands as have been included in homesteads, national forests, power sites, public water reserves, and State of Arizona school land grant, lieu or indemnity selections, an area much smaller than that named in the bill.</p> <p>
The bill further provides that, after payment for the lands that have been included in homesteads, etc., the remaining acreage of ceded lands shall be reopened to location and entry under the public land and mineral entry laws of the United States. While I would not favor legislation that would provide for the payment to the Indians of $1.25 per acre for this remaining acreage, I would favor its restoration to the Indians. The provision of the pending bill reopening these lands to public entry, and thus depriving the Indians of the future use of the lands and even of their present receipts from such lands, appears to me definitely objectionable.</p><pb n="2" />
<fw> 2	PAYMENT TO SAN CARLOS APACHE INDIANS </fw>
<p>It seems to me that this legislation is also objectionable because of its specific description of a payment for a total of 232,320 acres of land when it is apparent that the amount provided in the bill represents payment for a very much smaller acreage.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, I feel that this matter should receive the further consideration of Congress, and that I would not, therefore, be justified in approving the present bill.</p>

<head>PAYMENT TO SAN CARLOS APACHE INDIANS&#8212;VETO MESSAGE
(S. DOC. NO. 128)</head>
<p>The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, which was read, and with the accompanying bill, referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs and ordered to be printed:</p>
<opener>
<salute>To the Senate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I return herewith, without my approval, S. 18, a bill "Authorizing payment to the San Carlos Apache Indians for the lands ceded by them in the agreement of February 25, 1896, ratified by the act of June 10, 1896, and reopening such lands to mineral entry."</p>
<p>The bill provides, by a declaration to that effect, for the payment to the San Carlos Apache Indians of $33,725 for 232,320 acres of land. It would appear, however, that this represents in reality a payment at $1.25 per acre, for such ceded lands as have been included in homesteads, national forests, power sites, public water reserves, and State of Arizona school land grant, lien or indemnity selections, an area much smaller than that named in the bill.</p>
<p>The bill further provides that, after payment for the lands that have been included in homesteads, and so forth, the remaining acreage of ceded lands shall be reopened to location and entry under the public-land and mineral-entry laws of the United States. While I would not favor legislation that would provide for the payment to the Indians of $1.25 per acre for this remaining acreage, I would favor its restoration to the Indians. The provision of the pending bill re-opening these lands to public entry, and thus depriving the Indians of the future use of the lands and even of their present receipts from such lands, appears to me definitely objectionable.</p>

<head>INTERLOCKING BANK DIRECTORATES&#8212;VETO MESSAGE (S. DOC.
NO. 126)</head>
<p>The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, which was read, and with the accompanying bill, referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency and ordered to be printed:</p>
<opener>
<salute>To the Senate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I return herewith,, without my approval, Senate bill 2150, "An act to amend section 8 of the act entitled `An act to supplement laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes,' particularly with reference to interlocking bank directorates, known as the Clayton Act." If it was in the public interest in 1935 for the Congress to decide to terminate these relationships, it is in the public interest to terminate them now. Affected banks and affected directorates have had over 4 years to make adjustments. That would seem to be a liberal time.</p>
<p>If the Congress wishes to reverse itself and allow inter-locking directorships in the future, it can, of course, do so. But I do not think that the Congress should nullify its policy, declared in 1935, by extending interlocking directorships for another 4 years on top of the 4 years' extension which has already been given.</p>
