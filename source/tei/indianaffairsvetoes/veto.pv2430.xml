32350	CONGRESSIONAL RECORDâ€”HOUSE	October 12, 1984
The ACC, however, would be based on the discredited approach to youth unemployment that relies on artificial public sector employment, just as did the Public Service Employment pro-gram operated under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act until it was terminated by Congress in 1981.
Moreover, the ACC is not a necessary or effective way of managing Federal lands. The Federal Government currently spends over $4 billion annually on land management. This amount is adequate to fund all activities needed to ensure the preservation of these precious resources for this and future generations of Americans. Any conservation project that could be performed by the ACC could be done better and for less money under existing programs, because of less overhead for residential centers and the greater productivity of existing workers who are already well trained. In addition, I have recently signed S. 864, which would expand the National Park Service's volunteer program, and allow such a program to be established in the Bureau of Land Management. Under these worthwhile programs, including those administered by the Forest Service and the Fish and Wild-life Service, citizens offer valuable volunteer services to assist the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior in the management of Federal lands.
Finally, while the three year, $225 million ACC authorization is itself unwarranted, it would almost certainly grow. The Youth Conservation Corps began in 1971 as a $1 million pilot pro-gram, and was subsequently given a permanent authorization of $60 mil-lion annually, notwithstanding its in-ability to provide enduring, meaningful benefits for the trainees or the public. Moreover, the proponents of the ACC have already served notice that they intend to attempt in the next Congress to increase the ACC authorization to $300 million annually.
I believe that America's unemployed youth would be better served by reducing Federal spending so that more re-sources are available to the private sector of our economy to fuel a continuation of the current economic expansion that has added 6 million new jobs to the workforce over the last two years. If given the opportunity, the private sector is much more likely to offer young people promising career opportunities than temporary make-work Federal job programs such as the American Conservation Corps.

H.R. 5172
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval of H.R. 5172, which includes the "Nation-al Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1985" (Title I), clarifications of the role of the Nation-al Science Foundation in engineering research and education (Title II), and the "Manufacturing Sciences and Robotics Research and Development Act of 1984" (Title III). Title I would, among other things, authorize appropriations for certain Department of Commerce programs for fiscal year 1985, for which appropriations have already been enacted.
Title III of H.R. 5172 would establish a new program providing Federal financial support for a variety of re-search, development, education, and training activities, whose purported purpose would be to improve manufacturing technologies, including robotics and automation. These activities would total $250 million during fiscal years 1985-1988, and represent an unwarranted role for the Federal government. The decisions on how to allocate investments for research on manufacturing technologies are best left to American industry. It is highly doubtful that this Act and resulting Federal expenditures would improve the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.
The new role for the Federal government contemplated by Title III could also serve as the basis for a Federal industrial policy to influence our Nation's technological development. This Administration has steadfastly op-posed such a role for the Federal government.
My Administration has fostered the development of a robust and improving economy, which will do more than anything to improve the growth and productivity of the industrial sector. We will continue our efforts to improve the general economy, the regulatory environment, and tax policies that are essential if U.S. industry is to remain competitive. I cannot, however, approve legislation that would result in significant Federal expenditures with little or no assurance that there are any benefits to be gained.
I am, therefore, constrained to with-hold my approval from H.R. 5172.
RONALD REAGAN.
THE WHITE HOUSE, October 30, 1984.
H.R. 5760
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval of H.R. 5760, a bill "To declare that the United States holds certain lands in trust for the Cocopah Indian Tribe of Arizona, and for other purposes."
Title I of H.R. 5760 would declare that almost 4,000 acres of Federal land in Yuma County, Arizona, be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Cocopah Indian Tribe. I do not object to this provision.
Title II of H.R. 5760 would allow the Navajo Tribe to reassert against the United States, vague and uncertain claims originally brought in July 1950, but voluntarily and legally withdrawn by their counsel in October 1969. The propriety and finality of counsel's action were subsequently given ex-haustive consideration. Navajo Tribe v. United States, 220 Ct. Cl. 350, 601 F. 2d 536 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1072 (1980). In the meantime, some claims which might be affected by H.R. 5760 have been settled or litigated, and others have been placed on a detailed trial schedule. Enactment of H.R. 5760 could compel protracted re-negotiation, retrial or delay in the trial of these claims, based upon vague and speculative allegations.
Absent a compelling showing that a substantial injustice would result from adherence to procedural norms, the limitations of the Indian Claims Act and the procedures adopted for the adjudication of claims under the Act should not be frustrated by special legislation, such as that contained in title II of H.R. 5760. No such showing has been made here.
Title II would interfere with the fair and orderly adjudication of the claims of the Navajo Tribe and would constitute an affront to established rules, procedures, and principles for the resolution of Indian claims. It could serve to encourage other and future efforts to obtain by legislation that which has been unattainable through adjudication.
For these reasons, I find that bill unacceptable. If Title I were presented as a separate bill, I would have no objection to its enactment.
RONALD REAGAN. THE WHITE HOUSE, October 30, 1984.
H.R. 5479
MEMORANDUM OF DISAPPROVAL
I am withholding my approval of H.R. 5479, a bill "to amend section 504 of title 5, United States Code, and section 2412 of title 28, United States Code, with respect to awards of expenses of . certain agency and court proceedings, and for other purposes."
H.R. 5479 would permanently reauthorize and make a number of significant changes to the Equal Access to Justice Act. The Act allows the award of attorneys' fees to certain parties who successfully litigate against the government unless the government demonstrates that its position is substantially justified or that special circumstances exist that make a fee award unjust. Because the Equal Access to Justice Act expired on September 30, 1984, legislation is needed to reauthorize the Act.
</body>I am firmly committed to the policies underlying the Equal Access to Justice Act and will make the permanent and retroactive reauthorization of the Act a high legislative priority of the Administration in the next Congress. Where the Federal government has taken a position in litigation that is not substantially justified, and thereby has caused a small business or individual to incur unnecessary attorneys' fees and legal costs, I believe it proper for the government to reim-
