                <p>Charles J. Kappler (1868&#8211;1946) is known primarily for his compilation,
                        <title>Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties</title>. His life, however, reached
                    beyond this accumulation of fundamental documents. He was a staff member of,
                    among other entities, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs; served as
                    co-counsel in the first case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
                    Hague; brought important tribal issues before the courts, just a quarter century
                    after the Battle of the Little Big Horn; married, was widowed, married again,
                    developed a family, and found a place in District society; and, in one role or
                    another, participated in a number of major Indian law cases before the United
                    States Supreme Court, prior to the creation of the Indian Claims Commission.</p>

                    <quote>"In the first place, this Court does not possess any treaty-making power.
                        That power belongs by the constitution to another department of the
                        Government; and to alter, amend, or add to any treaty, by inserting any
                        clause, whether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our part
                        an usurpation of power, and not an exercise of judicial functions. It would
                        be to make, and not to construe a treaty. Neither can this Court supply a
                        casus omissus in a treaty, any more than in a law. We are to find out the
                        intention of the parties by just rules of interpretation applied to the
                        subject matter; and having found that, our duty is to follow it as far as it
                        goes, and to stop where that stops – whatever may be the imperfections or
                        difficulties which it leaves behind"</quote>

                    <p>The study of the relationships formed between the federal government and the
                        American Indian tribes has been a subject of national interest for over two
                        hundred years. A fundamental asset to such examinations is the array of 375
                        treaties, recognized by the Department of State and the courts,<ref n="1"
                            target="n01"/> which link together these sovereigns.</p>

                    <p>For the last century, a major source of the final texts of most of these
                        instruments has been the compilation of Charles J. Kappler's <title>Indian
                            Affairs: Laws and Treaties</title> (1904a&#8211;1941), a collection
                        that, at Kappler's death, was described as "a five-volume reference work
                        accepted as authoritative by the highest courts" (Charles Kappler Dies;
                        Expert and Writer on Indian Affairs, 1946).<ref n="2" target="n02"/> Volume
                        2, with the content of these negotiations, has been especially useful
                        (Kappler, 1904b). Digital conversions of his work, and of the few treaties
                        not included in his volumes, have made these materials even more accessible
                        (Bernholz and Holcombe, 2005; Bernholz, Pytlik Zillig, Weakly, and Bajaber,
                        2006).</p>

                    <p>Few realize, however, that following his service with the federal government
                        during which he began to assemble <title>Indian Affairs</title>, Kappler was deeply
                        involved in proceedings before various jurisdictions that centered upon
                        these very documents. His efforts on behalf of the tribes, in fact, led to
                        his adoption by the Crow.</p>

                    <p>Charles J. Kappler was a life-long resident of Washington, DC,
                        commencing with his birth on 16 November 1868, the son of German immigrants
                        Anton and Suzanna (n&#233;e Walter), a shoemaker and housewife (Leonard,
                        1925, p. 803).<ref n="3" target="n03"/> The 1880 Census record indicates
                        siblings consisting of two older brothers (Frank and Henry), a sister in
                        between these two (Mary), and one younger sister (Annie) (Department of the
                        Interior, 1880a). Kappler "graduated from public and parochial schools of
                        the District" (Charles Kappler Dies; Expert and Writer on Indian Affairs,
                        1946) and then studied stenography and typing with Theodore F. Shuey, the
                        dean of Congressional reporters at that time (Charles Kappler is Authority
                        on Indian Laws and Treaties, 1941; Heckel, 1968).</p>

                    <p>After these studies, and while working as secretary to Senator William M.
                        Stewart (1827&#8211;1909; R-Nevada) &#8212; an administrative post
                        held years earlier by Mark Twain<ref n="4" target="n04"/> &#8212;
                        Kappler became involved with irrigation issues, stimulated by his
                        participation in Stewart's two month fact finding odyssey through the
                        Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, California,
                        Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the Fall of 1889 (see Mack, 1964, pp.
                            78&#8211;80).<ref n="5" target="n05"/> The group was accompanied by
                        the second Director of the United States Geological Survey, Major John
                        Wesley Powell. During a tough Senate campaign, Stewart had Kappler speak
                        publicly of the Senator's achievements (Kappler, 1892) and make the
                        presentation speech at the University in Reno for a portrait of the Senator
                        (Presentation of Senator Stewart's Portrait, 1892); both opportunities were
                        good practice for his future law endeavors. Besides his service to Stewart,
                        Kappler graduated from the Law School at Georgetown University with his LLB
                        degree in 1896 and LLM the following year.<ref n="6" target="n06"/> He was
                        admitted to the Bar in 1896 and to the United States Supreme Court in
                        December of the same year (New Lawyers Admitted to Bar, 1896; Kappler, 1896
                        and 1901).</p>

                    <p>Kappler also, for a time in 1897, managed Stewart's <title>Silver
                            Knight-Watchman</title> newspaper while the Senator tried to find funds
                        to assure its survival; the paper failed in 1899 (Elliot, 1983). When
                        Stewart became Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs for the
                        57th and 58th Congresses between 1901 and 1905, Kappler served as Clerk to
                        that Committee and became more involved with federal Indian law.<ref n="7"
                            target="n07"/></p>

                    <p>For several years prior to 1901, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs included
                        a request in his annual reports to Congress for an accurate and current
                        compilation of the treaties, laws, and executive orders pertaining to Indian
                        affairs (see Annual reports of the Department of the Interior for the fiscal
                        year ended June 30, 1899, Indian Affairs, Part I, 1899, p. 75).<ref n="8"
                            target="n08"/> Stewart submitted a resolution to create a collation of
                        pertinent materials (Compilation on Indian Affairs, 1902a) and steered the
                        process through the Senate (Compilation on Indian Affairs, 1902b; Treaties,
                        laws, etc., relating to Indian affairs, 1903). The resolution initially met
                        with some resistance by Senator Eugene Hale (1836&#8211;1918; R-Maine),
                        who objected to the endeavor if it was to require additional funds to
                        produce, citing other subject collections that resulted in inferior, poorly
                        indexed works. Hale's concerns were assuaged by Stewart, who pledged the
                        work would be "accurate, well-indexed and [have] the approval of the
                        Interior Department" (Compilation of Indian Affairs, 1902b, p. 5664).
                        Kappler &#8212; beginning in 1903, and continuing until 1941 while he
                        practiced law &#8212; compiled his five-volume <title>Indian Affairs:
                            Laws and Treaties</title> to assemble the relevant but widely scattered
                        materials in this area (Charles Kappler is Authority on Indian Laws and
                        Treaties, 1941). The treaties alone were easily accessible because all but
                        nine of the recognized documents were published in ten volumes of the
                            <title>Statutes at Large</title>,<ref n="10" target="n10"/> but a
                        concurrent resolution in December 1903 assured the availability of all these
                        collected materials in a single source (<title>Indian treaties</title>,
                        1904).</p>

                    <p>Further, Kappler served as co-counsel in 1902 in one of the earliest
                        international arbitration cases, <title>Pious Fund of the Californias v.
                            Mexico</title>, the first case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration
                        in The Hague.<ref n="11" target="n11"/> Senator Stewart and Kappler
                        submitted a Statement on Behalf of the United States to the Court (Appendix
                        II, 1903, pp. 245&#8211;261),<ref n="12" target="n12"/> and Stewart
                        began the oral presentations in the case that lasted ten days (Opening
                        Arguments In Pious Fund Case, 1902; Elliott, 1983, p. 236).<ref n="13"
                            target="n13"/> This supplement augmented a section in a volume of
                        Foreign Relations of the United States that collated the correspondence
                        associated with the <title>Pious Fund</title> case (Papers relating to the
                        foreign relations of the United States, with the annual message of the
                        President transmitted to Congress December 2, 1902, 1903, pp.
                        738&#8211;786). After Stewart's departure from the Senate in March 1905,
                        Kappler opened the Kappler &amp; Merillat law office<ref n="14"
                            target="n14"/> with Charles H. Merillat<ref n="15" target="n15"/> and
                        worked in this partnership<ref n="16" target="n16"/> until 1913 when he
                        began to practice alone.<ref n="17" target="n17"/></p>

                    <p>In August 1914, Kappler married Katherine Shuey, and they had two children,
                            Suzanne<ref n="18" target="n18"/> and Charles.<ref n="19" target="n19"/>
                        Katherine's father was the famed Senate reporter for the
                            <title>Congressional Record</title>, Theodore F. Shuey, mentor of
                        Kappler. Shuey's long service &#8212; 61 years at that instant
                        &#8212; was commemorated in a 1930 <title>Time</title> magazine article;
                        he was 85 years old at the time (Reporter's Birthday, 1930). He died a few
                        years later, and his obituary declared that he had seen "all inaugural rites
                        since 1869" (T. F. Shuey, Senate Aid 65 Years, Dead, 1933). Katherine
                        Kappler died as the result of cancer in May of 1949 (Certificate of Death,
                        1949). Her obituary indicated that she had had an active life, including her
                        long-time participation in the Washington Club, a ladies' private social
                        club for literary and educational purposes founded in 1891 (Mrs. K. Shuey
                        Kappler Dies Here at 61, 1949), and her involvement in current issues such
                        as the "great sociological movement," birth control (Birth Control Wins
                        Favor, Group Told, 1940, p. X12).</p>

                    <p>Both Charles and Katherine had been married previously. Charles had wed
                        Isabel ("Belle") Johnson on 5 November 1896 (Marriage Registry, 1896; Social
                        and Personal, 1896); there is a record of two real estate transfers (The
                        Legal Record, 1905a and b) concerning lots in Widow's Mite, one of the
                        original eighteen parcels of land that eventually became the city of
                        Washington (Some Facts About the 'Widow's Mite,' 1921). This area held
                        within its 600 acre boundaries today's Dupont Circle; Senator Stewart lived
                        nearby in "Stewart's Castle," constructed in 1882 (A Short History of a Very
                        Round Place, 1990). Belle is cited alone in other transactions (Real Estate
                        Transfers, 1899; The Legal Record, 1906). There is even one legal notice
                        that listed her sole participation in one business deal, along with a record
                        of the two of them completing another (Real Estate Transfers, 1909). She
                        died on 8 July 1912, after a year-long bout with pernicious anemia
                        (Certificate of Death, 1912; Died, 1912). Katherine had married Holbrook
                        Bonney on 16 February 1909 (Miss Shuey a Bride, 1909) and had divorced him
                        in January 1914 (Wins Her Divorce, 1914).</p>

                    <p>During his career as an attorney, Kappler's specialties included Indian,
                        mining, oil, and land law, and he represented various Indian tribes before
                        both the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court. His service to the Crow led
                        to his adoption by that tribe in 1931 (Charles J. Kappler, Prominent
                        Washington Attorney, Adopted into Crow Indian Tribe, 1931).<ref n="20"

                    <p>Kappler died of heart failure on 20 January 1946 (Certificate of Death, 1946;
                        Charles Kappler Dies; Expert and Writer on Indian Affairs, 1946) and was

                    <p>It would be a disservice to speak of Kappler's life without commenting
                        briefly upon his compilation, <title>Indian Affairs: Laws and
                        Treaties</title>. Throughout the eighteenth century, preservation of the
                        various treaties created between the federal government and the tribes was
                        not of major importance. Three prior efforts to assemble these legal
                        materials included <title>Indian Treaties, and Laws and Regulations Relating
                            to Indian Affairs</title> (1826); <title>Treaties between the United
                            States of America and the Several Indian Tribes, From 1778 to
                        1837</title> (1837); and <title>A Compilation of All the Treaties between
                            the United States and the Indian Tribes Now in Force as Laws</title>
                        (1873). As noted earlier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs William Atkinson
                        Jones had proposed in 1899 and 1900 a new, up to date collection. In a
                        portion of his 1900 Annual Report entitled "Needed Publication on Indian
                        Matters," he remarked that the 1873 attempt was "inaccurate" and that "[t]he
                        demand for a publication that shall contain all ratified treaties and
                        agreements made by the United States with the Indian tribes is increasing.
                        It would be in constant use in this office and would be frequently referred
                        to by other Government bureaus and by members of Congress as well as by the
                        public at large" (Annual reports of the Department of the Interior for the
                        fiscal year ended June 30, 1900. Indian Affairs. Report of Commissioner and
                        Appendixes, 1900, p. 50). Jones repeated this recommendation for a third
                        time in the 1901 Annual Report (Annual reports of the Department of the
                        Interior for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1901. Indian Affairs. Part I.
                        Report of the Commissioner, and appendixes, 1901, pp. 46&#8211;47),
                        repeating much of what he had said the year before. When Senator Stewart
                        defended his resolution for a fresh attempt in May 1902, he recalled these
                        requests when he stated that "the Secretary of the Interior has recommended
                        for several years a compilation of treaties and Executive orders"
                        (Compilation on Indian Affairs, 1902b, p. 5664).</p>

                    <p>As directed then by the Senate's decision to proceed, Kappler, as Clerk for
                        the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, compiled these relevant yet
                        dispersed materials. The first two volumes, as Senate Document 452 and for
                        data through 1 December 1902, were published in 1903, as successive
                            <title>Serial Set</title> items. Volume 1 consisted of "Statutes,
                        executive orders, proclamations, and statistics of tribes." It was released
                        as the 1,169 page <title>Serial Set</title> volume 4253. Volume 2,
                        comprising the treaties, in <title>Serial Set</title> volume 4254, contained
                        832 pages (Kappler, 1903a and b). Funding for this work was included in the
                        March 1903 appropriations bill: "[t]o pay the persons who compiled and
                        indexed the two volumes of the treaties, laws, Executive orders, and so
                        forth, relating to Indian affairs, under Senate resolution of May twentieth,
                        nineteen hundred and two, five thousand dollars of which said sum so much as
                        may be necessary, may be expended as additional pay or compensation to any
                        officer or employee of the United States, to be immediately available, and
                        to be paid only upon vouchers signed by the chairman of the Committee on
                        Indian Affairs of the Senate" (<title>An act making appropriations for the
                            current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department and for
                            fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes for the fiscal
                            year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and four, and for other
                            purposes</title>, 1903, p. 1000).</p>

                    <p>The following year, the same materials were republished as Senate Document
                        319, with changes to their formats (Kappler, 1904a and b). Kappler noted in
                        the preface to the second edition (1904a, p. v) that "[t]he new edition has
                        afforded the compiler an opportunity to make such typographical and other
                        corrections as were discovered in the first print, to insert several
                        treaties and documents which were heretofore unobtainable, and to add the
                        signatures subscribed to each treaty which was omitted in the first edition
                        to save space." The new set of volumes was accessible as <title>Serial
                        Set</title> volume 4623 and 4624, with the second volume, now including
                        signatures, extended to 1,099 pages.</p>

                    <p>Three later volumes appeared: Senate Document 719 (Kappler, 1913;
                            <title>Serial Set</title> 6166); Senate Document 53 (Kappler, 1929;
                            <title>Serial Set</title> 8849); and Senate Document 194 (Kappler, 1941;
                            <title>Serial Set</title> 10458) as volumes 3 though 5, respectively,
                        with relevant contemporary federal Indian law materials. At the point when
                        the fourth volume was ordered to be printed (Printing of manuscripts
                        relating to Indian affairs, 1928), the Senate Committee on Printing noted
                        that the three previous volumes were "widely used" (p. 1) and that the
                        Secretary of the Interior, Hubert Work, had declared in 1925 that "[t]he
                        compilation of Indian laws and treaties is constantly used and referred to
                        in this department and the office of Indian Affairs, as well as at the
                        several Indian agencies, where the Statutes at Large are not always
                        available" (p. 2) . Later, publishers other than the Government Printing
                        Office created versions for these collations. Further, the second or
                        treaties volume was printed as a stand-alone publication (Kappler, 1972a,
                        1973), and a new set of all five volumes was offered in 1972 (Kappler,
                        1972b).</p>

                    <p>The second volume of final treaty texts has been particularly useful since
                        its publication, because the stream of court cases addressing Indian issues
                        began in earnest at the turn of the twentieth century. Many important cases
                        had occurred earlier, but the handling of Indian affairs in the new century,
                        of the tribes' assertions of their rights promised by these treaties, and of
                        their claims against the government for the absence of these assurances
                        became more prevalent. Francis E. Leupp, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
                        between 1905 and 1908, wrote in favor of either a special court or some sort
                        of extension of the Court of Claims to assess fairly the numerous Indian
                        claims (Leupp, 1910, p. 196). The eventual creations of United States
                        citizenship for Indians (<title>An act to authorize the Secretary of the
                            Interior to issue certificates of citizenship to Indians</title>, 1924)
                        and of the Indian Claims Commission (<title>An act to create an Indian
                            Claims Commission, to provide for the powers, duties, and functions
                            thereof, and for other purposes</title>, 1946) were manifestations of
                        this activity.</p>

                    <p>Reliance upon the documents of negotiation between the tribes and the federal
                        government thus became paramount for the courts. The expanded version of
                        volume 2 (Kappler, 1904b) contains 388 documents, divided into two sections.
                        A general treaty text portion holds 371 documents, consisting of 364
                        treaties recognized by the Department of State (<title>Ratified Indian
                            Treaties, 1722&#8211;1869</title>, 1966) and of seven supplemental
                        documents. Seventeen more items reside in an appendix, of which the first
                        two are acknowledged instruments.<ref n="22" target="n22"/></p>

                    <p>In 1968, the Indian Civil Rights Act was passed. In the Title VII &#8212;
                        Materials Relating to Constitutional Rights of Indians section of the Act,
                        the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to "revise and extend"
                        Kappler's compilation "to include all treaties, laws, executive orders and
                        regulations relating to Indian Affairs in force on September 1, 1967"
                            (<title>An act to prescribe penalties for certain acts of violence or
                            intimidation, and for other purposes</title>, 1968, p. 81). This led to
                        the creation of an additional 160 page supplement (Department of the
                        Interior, 1975) to handle only the revisions made to federal regulations
                        related to Indians; provisions in Title 25 &#8212; Indians of the
                            <title>Code of Federal Regulations</title> were excluded from this
                        publication. The Foreword (p. ii) stated: "The original and revised editions
                        of Senate Document 319 of the 58th Congress, entitled <title>Indian Affairs:
                            Laws and Treaties</title> (popularly called "Kapplers") did not include
                        federal regulations. Indeed, federal regulations were not available in the
                        present codified form until 1935 when Congress directed a compilation of all
                        documents of 'general applicability and legal effect.'" As a result, the
                        publication included relevant regulations from twelve Titles of the
                            <title>Code of Federal Regulations</title>.<ref n="23" target="n23"/></p>

                    <p>All five volumes were reprinted in 1975 by the Government Printing Office
                        (Kappler, 1975). Physically, volume number 4 of this later edition had a
                        page gap between Part VIII &#8212; Appendix and the place where the
                        indexes for volumes 1 through 3 used to reside in the original 1929
                        rendition. The index for this new version began on page 1345, with the note
                        "Indexes to Volumes I, II, and II, pp. 1195&#8211;1344, have been
                        omitted."</p>

                    <p>The Department of the Interior subsequently published, in 1979, a sixth and a
                        seventh volume, under the title Kappler's <title>Indian Affairs: Laws and
                            Treaties</title> (Department of the Interior, 1979a and b). No further

                    <p>It is clear that his contributions to government were considerable, yet
                        Kappler's later involvement as an attorney is impressive as well. The cases
                        noted below have been accumulated to demonstrate his service within
                        jurisprudence and were collated solely to identify his diversification.
                        These proceedings are divided into two groups &#8212; those that cited

                        illustrate his skills and interests.</p>

                    <p>Locating Kappler's cases was achieved by interrogating the "Federal &amp;

                        database for COUNSEL (Kappler OR Merillat) cases. In a similar fashion, the
                        ALLCASES option of the full <title>Westlaw</title> system was examined with
                        the search element AT (Kappler Merillat). In this manner, Table I was
                        constructed to identify, in total, 91 cases between 1904 and 1945.<ref

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Table I identifies the 91 cases in which Kappler participated. Of these
                        suits, the 28 highlighted ones referred specifically to 38 of the 375
                        recognized treaties with the tribes (<title>Ratified Indian Treaties,
                            1722&#8211;1869</title>, 1966). Each of these 38 individual
                        documents is paired with the case name of each citing suit from Table I to
                        form the contents of Table II. For example, the third entry in Table II
                        highlights ratified treaty number 43, the <title>
                            <ref n="http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/sau0074.htm">Treaty with the Sauk and Foxes, 1804</ref>
                        </title> (Kappler, 1904b, pp. 74&#8211;77). Two cases in which Kappler
                        participated &#8212; <title>Sac and Fox Indians of Iowa v. Sac and Fox
                            Indians of Oklahoma</title> (1910) and <title>Sac and Fox Indians of the
                            Mississippi in Iowa v. Sac and Fox Indians of the Mississippi in
                            Oklahoma</title> (1911) &#8212; cited this specific treaty and so
                        are collected together here. This strong linkage, between his personal
                        interest in Indian affairs and his collation of what became the primary
                        source for the final texts of recognized treaties with the tribes, is a
                        reflection of the new approach taken with the tribes during the New Deal
                            era.<ref n="26" target="n26"/> This focus was also evident in the life
                        and work of Felix S. Cohen.<ref n="27" target="n27"/></p>

                    <p>The presence of each specific treaty-citing proceeding was checked in the
                        case lists of Cohen's original work on American Indian law (1942); of the
                        revamped version of this collation by the Department of the Interior (1958);
                        of a subsequent edition under the Cohen model (Strickland, 1982); of a newer
                        presentation of these materials (Smith, 2004); and of the latest recasting
                        of the Cohen approach (Newton, 2005). The last five columns of Table I
                        mirror this analysis. These texts are the fundamental sources for the
                        understanding of American Indian law and their inclusion of so many of
                        Kappler's cases illuminates the place of this attorney at the very center of
                        the development of this jurisprudence during the first half of the twentieth
                        century.</p>

                    <p>Special attention should be drawn to six special situations.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>
                            <p>First, Kappler was counsel for John Kenny &#8212; whose name was
                                apparently misspelled before the Court &#8212; in the 1917
                                United States Supreme Court appearance, <title>Kenney v.
                                Miles</title> (1917), while his former partner, Charles H. Merillat,
                                was attorney for the respondents.<ref n="28" target="n28"/> This was
                                just a few years after the two had dissolved their partnership.</p>

                            <p>Briefly, in these proceedings, John Kenny successfully petitioned for
                                a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma.
                                Before this state venue (<title>Kenny v. Miles</title>, 1917), the
                                results of previous county and district court cases, regarding the
                                partitioning of allotted and patented lands totaling 660 acres left
                                upon the 1908 death of Lah-tah-sah, an enrolled Osage woman, were
                                appealed. In both of the earlier actions, Kenny, her only child,
                                maintained the position that he was the sole heir and should receive
                                the entire property, while Miles, her surviving husband, asked for
                                one-half of the land. Both were duly enrolled Osage members and the
                                sole question before the district court was Miles's martial status
                                with Lah-tah-sah. This standing was decided in favor of Miles, the
                                lands were equally divided, and this distribution was made by the
                                court. In the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, Miles contended that his
                                wife's lands were selected after her death and "therefore such lands
                                are neither homestead nor surplus, but constitute a separate and
                                distinct class of allotment upon the alienation of which no
                                restrictions were imposed by Congress" (<title>Kenny v.
                                Miles</title>, 1917, p. 42). <ref n="29" target="n29"/> The Court
                                agreed and affirmed the district court's decision to equally divide
                                and distribute the property.</p>

                            <p>Two years later, the suit was heard before, and decided in Kenny's
                                favor by, the United States Supreme Court (<title>Kenny v.
                                Miles</title>, 1919). The judgment from the Supreme Court of
                                Oklahoma was reversed and defined "inoperative" (p. 65) because the
                                lands in question were determined to be restricted and thus
                                administrable under Congress's direction: "[w]e have seen that the
                                provision of the Act of 1912<ref n="30" target="n30"/> under which
                                the partition suit was brought and entertained declares that where
                                the lands are restricted, as was the case here, no partition or sale
                                of the restricted lands shall be valid <emph>until approved by the
                                    Secretary of the Interior</emph>" (p. 65; emphasis added). The
                                importance of the role of the Secretary of the Interior in such
                                Osage inheritance situations, as well as his responsibility to
                                exchange effectively surplus allotments, were thus affirmed. Many
                                such inheritance questions, and therefore court proceedings that
                                involved attorneys such as Kappler and Merillat, were caused by the
                                complexities resulting from the application of the General Allotment
                                    Act<ref n="31" target="n31"/> that dispersed millions of acres
                                of tribal lands.</p>
                        </item>

                        <item>
                            <p>Second, the Leonard (1925) pr&#233;cis for Kappler indicated a
                                number of "leading cases." All but one of these is represented in
                                Table I. The only exception of these important suits was
                                    <title>Grace Cox</title> (1913), an inheritance case involving
                                Omaha trust lands that was decided by the Office of Indian Affairs
                                at the Department of the Interior. The Twenty-seventh annual report
                                of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the
                                Smithsonian Institution, 1905&#8211;1906 (1911) contains an
                                article entitled "The Omaha Tribe" and an alphabetical index for the
                                "Original Owners of Allotments on Omaha Reservation" (pp.
                                643&#8211;654) which indicates that Grace Cox's designated 40
                                acre allotment was number 1003. The accompanying "Title Map
                                &#8212; Omaha Reservation, Thurston County, Nebraska" in that
                                volume shows her holdings, northeast of the town of Pender, at T. 25
                                N., R. 7 E., sec. 19, SW¼ NE¼. The case revolved around "one person
                                claiming as a "child" of the decedent, and two other persons denying
                                that claim and contending that they are the decedent's heirs as
                                half-sister and nephew of the "next of kin"" (<title>Grace
                                Cox</title>, 1913, p. 495).</p>

                            <p>Felix Cohen (1942, p. 110) noted this specific case in the
                                "Administrative Power &#8212; Individual Lands" section of his
                                chapter on "The Scope of Federal Power Over Indian Affairs." Its
                                importance lies in the application of <title>An act to provide for
                                    determining the heirs of deceased Indians, for the disposition
                                    and sale of allotments of deceased Indians, for the leasing of
                                    allotments, and for other purposes</title> (1910) that ensured
                                that the Secretary of the Interior was "not bound by decree or
                                decision of any court in inheritance proceedings affecting
                                restricted allotted lands" (Cohen, 1942, p. 110), and that,
                                according to the Act, "his decision thereon shall be final and
                                conclusive" (1910, p. 855).<ref n="32" target="n32"/> In
                                    <title>Grace Cox</title>, the Secretary exercised this authority
                                and ruled "that the alleged status of adoptive parent and adopted
                                child, as between Grace Cox and Jennie Woodhull, be not recognized"
                                    (<title>Grace Cox</title>, 1913, p. 502; emphasis original).<ref

                                challenging this power of the Secretary in such situations, failed
                                to modify this capacity until 1990.<ref n="34" target="n34"/></p>

                            <p>There is no indication of Kappler's status in this opinion,<ref
                                    n="35" target="n35"/> but this is another indication of his

                            <p>Third, Kappler was a petitioner and counsel in several income tax

                                    (<title>Kappler v. Sumpter</title>, 1909). In an additional case
                                pertaining to an unpaid legal fee (<title>Kappler v. Storm</title>,
                                1916), Kappler acted solely as plaintiff.</p>
                            <p>The <title>Owen</title> case concerned the question of whether a
                                distribution by a corporation to its shareholders was taxable.
                                Kappler, along with others in this appearance before the United
                                States Board of Tax Appeals, was a shareholder in the Osage Natural
                                Gas Company and his liability pertained to a $96.26 shortfall in
                                income tax paid for the year 1919. The majority shareowner, Charles
                                    Owen,<ref n="36" target="n36"/> had an exposure of $58,045.92,
                                but there were others named in the list of sixteen taxpayers who
                                owed less than Kappler. The court opinion identifies another
                                attorney, as well as two Certified Public Accountants, on the legal
                                team, so the effort must have been substantial. The appeal, however,
                                was denied.</p>
                            <p>The <title>Norcross</title> pair regarded another income tax
                                deficiency, of $250 for the year 1929. In these instances, Kappler
                                and three others unsuccessfully approached the United States Board
                                of Tax Appeals, and then the United States Court of Appeals for the
                                District of Columbia, to exempt them from federal income tax on
                                income paid by the state of Nevada.</p>
                            <p>It is interesting to note that Charles H. Merillat was involved in a
                                personal tax case, as well. <title>Merillat v. Commissioner of
                                    Internal Revenue</title> (1927) discussed his alleged payment
                                arrears of $884.11 for the 1921 tax year. It also indicated that,
                                besides his law practice, "since about 1912, he also has been
                                engaged in the business of leasing Indian oil lands in the State of
                                Oklahoma" and that these transactions were with "the Otoe and
                                Missouria Tribes of Indians" (p. 813). The question before the same
                                Board of Tax Appeals was whether certain payments made by Merillat
                                were rentals and so deductible. The tax shortfall was created when
                                these payments were ruled nondeductible business expenses, but the
                                Board determined that they were allowable and Merillat won his
                                appeal.</p>
                            <p>In the attorney substitution suit &#8212; <title>Kappler v.
                                    Sumpter</title> (1909) &#8212; the proceedings revolved
                                around two previous cases (<title>Garfield v. United States ex rel.
                                    Goldsby</title>, 1907 and 1908) which reversed the act of
                                deletion by the Secretary of the Interior of John E. Goldsby's name,
                                and ultimately the names of others, from the official Chickasaw
                                Nation citizenship and allotment rolls. Three Sumpter family members
                                were among the plaintiffs in <title>Goldsby</title>, but chose to
                                file separate petitions for the same outcome. In the process, they
                                acquired another attorney, William W. Wright, and discharged Kappler
                                and Merillat, without informing them. Wright filed the necessary
                                petition for Jacob D. Sumpter four months before Kappler and
                                Merillat brought their suit in which they claimed that they had been
                                inappropriately replaced. The Court of Appeals of the District of
                                Columbia found that "[a] party to a suit may change his attorney
                                when he sees fit, assuming the responsibility, of course, for his
                                breach of his contract with his former attorney" (<title>Kappler v.
                                    Sumpter</title>, 1909, p. 408) and the appeal was dismissed.</p>

                                Oklahoma, involved an alleged shortfall of $100 due counsel for
                                service in a prior Indian allotment case; the "judgment of the trial
                                court [was] reversed and the cause remanded" (<title>Kappler v.

                            <p>Fourth, in the briefs for three Court of Claims cases, Kappler
                                referenced unratified treaties. In <title>Rogers v. Osage Nation of
                                    Indians</title> (1910), the opinion stated (p. 389): "On May 27,
                                1868, commissioners on the part of the United States signed a treaty
                                with the Osage Nation of Indians, at Drum Creek, Kans., by the terms
                                of which the Lawrence, Leavenworth and Galveston Railroad Company
                                would have acquired the Osage trust land and the Osage diminished
                                reserve, comprising about 8,000,000 acres of land, for the price of
                                less than 20 cents an acre, to be paid for $100,000 in cash and
                                $1,500,000 in bonds of the railroad company that were not a mortgage
                                on the land conveyed for the deferred payments. The Drum Creek
                                treaty of 1868 was a direct violation of the treaty of 1865 between
                                the United States and the Osage Nation of Indians. The treaty
                                commissioners had been offered and refused to accept a higher price
                                than the railroad company was to pay." An examination of the briefs,
                                filed by Kappler and Merillat for this case, reveals far more
                                elements of the intrigue involved in this transaction.</p>

                            <p>A special jurisdictional act, as part of a huge appropriations bill,
                                had empowered the Court to "render a judgment or decree against the
                                Osage Nation of Indians for such amount, if any, as the court shall
                                find legally or equitably due for these services of said Adair and
                                Vann, either upon contract or upon a quantum meruit."<ref n="37"
                                    target="n37"/> Both Adair and Vann were Cherokee tribal members
                                and had worked successfully as attorneys to quash this transaction
                                with the railroad, primarily as representatives of the Cherokee and,
                                claimed in this suit, of the Osage as well. They were initially
                                promised by the Osage $4.2 million for their services, based on the
                                size of the proposed cession. This amount was not submitted to the
                                Secretary of the Interior for approval, as required by law in
                                    1872.<ref n="38" target="n38"/> Ultimately, authorization was
                                granted in 1874 for an amount of $50,000, but Rogers was brought as
                                "a suit to recover an alleged balance due upon a written agreement
                                for attorney's fees." This final agreement, totaling $230,000, had
                                been endorsed by the Osage council in 1873 after the $4.2 million
                                amount was considered by the attorneys themselves to be unwarranted
                                for their services (<title>Rogers v. Osage Nation of
                                Indians</title>, 1910, p. 391).<ref n="39" target="n39"/> Sue M.
                                Rogers was the wife, and the executrix of the estate, of William P.
                                Adair, while her co-petitioner, Cullus Mayes, was the administrator
                                of the estate of Clement N. Vann (Brief for Defendant, 1909, p.
                                844). They sought the remaining $180,000 from the last contract made
                                with the Osage.</p>

                            <p>A House Report (Osage Indian treaty, 1868, p. 2) had remarked, just
                                three weeks after the treaty signing, that "the Osages were
                                improperly influenced to consent to the signing of said treaty; that
                                they were very reluctant to execute it, and that at no time, before
                                or since its execution, were they satisfied to sell their lands at
                                such a price or upon such securities." The Court, forty years later,
                                concluded that "[t]here were so many factors and so many and varied
                                sources of influence brought to bear in a concerted effort to defeat
                                this treaty that to award compensation to the claimants upon the
                                theory of paramount or exclusive service would be an unjust
                                perversion of Indian funds" (<title>Rogers v. Osage Nation of
                                    Indians</title>, 1910, p. 393). Further, it determined that the
                                approved fee of $50,000 had been paid and accepted by the attorneys,
                                in lieu of all claims for past services and as full payment, and so
                                the case against the Osage was dismissed. In the efforts leading up
                                to this opinion, however, Kappler and Merillat supplied the court
                                with a particularly robust history of the sequence of events
                                surrounding these attempted transactions. They demonstrated also
                                that there was minimal, if any, evidence to support any real claim
                                for relief for the alleged activities by these two attorneys as
                                representatives of the Osage (Brief for Defendant, 1909, pp.
                                869&#8211;870 and 992&#8211;997). This included "the fact
                                that they appeared publicly as representatives <emph>in hostility to
                                    the Osages</emph>" (p. 995; emphasis added).</p>

                            <p>This Drum Creek instrument was discussed at length in Congress,
                                especially after the Osage Indian treaty House Report, went
                                unratified, and thus never warranted recognition by the Department
                                of State as a true treaty. Deloria and DeMallie (1999) included this
                                contract in their "Treaties and Agreements Rejected by Congress"
                                chapter and noted that this treaty "would have become a highly
                                publicized scandal had it been ratified, because it would have
                                transferred a large part of their lands to a railroad" (p. 746).
                                    <ref n="40" target="n40"/> Such outrage may be found in another

                                this general negative attitude towards the entire transaction was
                                confirmed finally through the withdrawal, by President Ulysses S.
                                Grant on 4 February 1870, of the Drum Creek treaty and three similar
                                proposals that questioned the policy of selling Indian land to
                                corporations (Brief for Defendant, 1909, p. 880).<ref n="41"

                                reveals that <title>Rogers</title> has never been referenced again,
                                while <title>Indians of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and
                                    Crow Nation</title> have been cited in numerous later cases.
                                Clearly, though, these three appearances before the Court of Claims
                                &#8212; and especially, the second and third &#8212;
                                illuminate Kappler's grasp of all relevant negotiations between the
                                tribes and the government, whether the transactions were recognized
                                by the Department of State or not. The exposure to treaty
                                manipulation and, in these specific examples, to the use of
                                unratified instruments to twist the valid ones; to the prospect of
                                fee gouging, as demonstrated in <title>Rogers</title>, through "a

                                receiving unconscionable considerations for, on top of losing, their
                                lands to railway companies; and to the humiliating stigma of taking
                                almost <emph>any</emph> handout from the federal government that
                                could be presented later in court as "gratuitous," brought home to
                                the tribes the vast gulf that would never be addressed without a
                                better avenue through the courts, especially given the added burden
                                of a special jurisdictional act by Congress required to even present
                                their case in a federal venue. These battles in the early twentieth
                                century would result in the Indian Claims Commission,<ref n="49"
                                    target="n49"/> and would provide the tribes with one final
                                opportunity to secure justice. This latter journey, begun in the
                                late 1940s, finally ended on 27 September 2006, when the

                            <p>Fifth, the decisions for the last two listed federal cases in which
                                Kappler participated were separated by less than a month. They were
                                the <title>Northwestern Bands of Shoshone Indians v. United
                                States</title> proceedings, before the United States Supreme Court
                                in March and April 1945, with the latter one a denied rehearing
                                    request.<ref n="51" target="n51"/> Wilkins (1997, pp.
                                136&#8212;165) discussed extensively the previous history, the
                                opinions of the Justices in the March 1945 outcome, and the number
                                of inconsistencies in those remarks that made more clouded the logic
                                applied to the result. The use of the <title>Shoshone</title> suite
                                in this note, though, is one of exhibition. Kappler was 76 years old
                                at the time, but these efforts were the culmination of his
                                activities on behalf of the tribes, as well as a model of court
                                cases that solidified the creation of the Indian Claims Commission.</p>

                            <p>Beginning in 1926, Merillat and Kappler had undertaken the task to
                                seek compensation for the taking of Shoshone lands (Wilkins, 1997,
                                p. 143), but the bands had to wait for a special jurisdictional act
                                to allow them to file suit against the federal government. Such
                                permission was unnecessary for non-Indians, who could apply
                                unimpeded to the United States Court of Claims for redress, but
                                tribes &#8212; with their treaty-based proceedings &#8212;
                                required these authorizations to gain access to the Court.</p>

                            <p>In 1929, such an act was passed for these Bands' complaint.<ref
                                    n="52" target="n52"/> They filed suit in the Court of Claims in
                                1931 to recover $15 million for the taking of more than 15 million
                                acres of their lands.<ref n="53" target="n53"/> The Court, in 1942,
                                ruled that the Bands were not entitled to this relief, on the
                                grounds that the jurisdictional act demanded that the court consider
                                only aspects of the 30 July 1863, <title>

                                growing out of" that treaty or related documents (45 Stat. 1407). It
                                did, however, indicate that the Bands were due $10,804.17 in lost
                                annuities, pledged in Article 3 of the <title>

                                of these March 1942 and the January 1944 cases). The government
                                demonstrated that it had made $10,816.48 in gratuitous expenditures
                                on behalf of the Bands. This offset amount eliminated any chance of

                                    Indian Reservation</title>, as part of a barrage of 82 cited
                                cases, were employed as demonstrations of supporting law for the
                                Band's petition to recover. The Supreme Court was not convinced by
                                these arguments and &#8212; with the twists and turns of their
                                opinion that are enumerated by Wilkins (1997) &#8212; the case
                                was closed. An immediate request for a rehearing, in April 1945, was
                                denied, even after an amicus curiae brief submitted by the American
                                Civil Liberties Union that, besides questioning the grounds of the
                                earlier outcome, warned that "[w]here minorities suffer, the
                                community at large is the loser" (Brief of the American Civil
                                Liberties Union in Support of Petition for Rehearing, 1945). After
                                roughly two decades, the Northwestern bands were not compensated for
                                either their lost lands or annuities. Kappler died the following
                                January.</p>

                            <p>As the last point, Table I indicates the numerous, recurring
                                citations to Kappler's cases made by various handbooks of federal
                                Indian law issued in the last six decades. Of special interest here
                                are the twenty Kappler cases cited in the Department of the
                                Interior's <title>Federal Indian Law</title> (1958). This monograph,
                                published twelve years after his death, was created with a mandate
                                to discredit the seminal work of Felix S. Cohen, the <title>Handbook
                                    of Federal Indian Law</title> (1942),<ref n="56" target="n56"/>
                                yet these suits involving Kappler &#8212; many conducted during
                                the prime of the New Deal years &#8212; could not be
                                disregarded. The third paragraph of the Introduction to
                                    <title>Federal Indian Law</title> (1958, p. 1), in an unmasked
                                declaration of support for the government's tribal termination
                                policy of the 1950s, stated: "Much of the earlier Federal law and
                                many Indian treaties now have only historical significance. As
                                national development and progress continue and as new patterns of
                                policy evolve, legal answers to questions of Federal Indian law will
                                be found predominately in the latest statutory law and
                                jurisdictional determinations of justiciable issues. Those are
                                stressed in this revision for the purpose not only of seeking
                                balance, to the extent practicable, but also for the purpose of
                                foreclosing, if possible, further uncritical use of the earlier
                                edition by judges, lawyers, and laymen."</p>

                            <p>This criticism certainly must have been proposed, in part, to counter
                                the New Deal-era perspective evident in the Foreword of Cohen's 1942
                                volume: "This <title>Handbook of Federal Indian Law</title> should
                                give to Indians useful weapons in the continual struggle that every
                                minority must wage to maintain its liberties, and at the same time
                                it should give to those who deal with Indians, whether on behalf of
                                the federal or state governments or as private individuals, the
                                understanding which may prevent oppression" (Cohen, 1942, p. v).
                                Cohen had formulated the <title>Wheeler-Howard</title> or
                                <title>Indian Reorganization Act<ref n="57" target="n57"/> in 1934</title> that served as
                                the pinnacle of New Deal Indian Affairs legislation. The creation of
                                tribal constitutions, as forwarded by the <title>Act</title>, was a
                                far cry from the approach engendered in the termination policies of
                                the 1950s.<ref n="58" target="n58"/></p>

                            <p>Further, in an echo of the 1946 obituary citing Kappler's skills
                                (Charles Kappler Dies; Expert and Writer on Indian Affairs, 1946),
                                and just two years before the appearance of <title>Federal Indian
                                    Law</title>, United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl
                                Warren called Cohen "an acknowledged expert in Indian law"
                                    (<title>Squire v. Capoeman</title>, 1956, p. 8). The
                                Introduction to the second edition of Cohen's work (Strickland,
                                1982). emphasized again that <title>Federal Indian Law</title> was
                                written when termination was in the forefront of federal Indian
                                policy, and as such, Cohen's work had "proved embarrassing" (p. ix).
                                It was also concluded that Interior's revision "did not reflect
                                Felix Cohen's work," that his "carefully considered conclusions were
                                omitted," that cautiously crafted historical analyses were
                                "discarded," and that "the scholarship of the 1958 edition was
                                inadequate."</p>

                            <p>In the early 1990s, another resource bought together the outcomes of
                                the adjudication of Federal Indian law during the previous decade.
                                Its primary focus was on "[t]he states, particularly those in the
                                West . . . [that] encounter issues of Indian law with far more
                                frequency than most entities," and because "Indian law has become a
                                major part of the business of the offices of the western attorneys
                                general" (Smith, 2004, p. xxi). Because of this enduring concern,
                                the initial <title>American Indian Law Deskbook</title> has now
                                evolved into a third edition, carrying on the positive example that
                                Cohen had set six decades earlier.</p>

                            <p>Finally, in 2005, the third edition of the <title>Handbook of Federal
                                    Indian Law</title> was published (Newton, 2005). Its size
                                &#8212; over 1400 pages in twenty-two chapters &#8212; was a
                                direct indicator of the evolution of federal Indian law. Cohen's
                                "focus and coherence to this confusing welter of sources" (p. ix)
                                has been carried forward to support his desire to protect and
                                encourage tribal status and development. The growth these days
                                &#8212; much like that prior to the 1982 edition &#8212; is
                                so intense that updates to the 2005 <title>Handbook</title> are
                                projected, thereby avoiding the long lapses that stymied the
                                understanding of federal Indian law.</p>

                            <p>Absent all the difficulties involved in the production of these
                                handbooks over the last sixty-five years, federal Indian law remains
                                founded upon the legislation that sustained the contents of the 375
                                treaties created prior to 3 March 1871 by the British and the United
                                States governments and now recognized by the Department of State.
                                Cohen, in his bibliography (1942, p. 638), cited just four sources
                                for "Collections of Treaties:" the three 19th century items that
                                Commissioner of Indian Affairs Jones had found lacking &#8212;
                                    <title>Indian Treaties, and Laws and Regulations Relating to
                                    Indian Affairs</title> (1826); <title>Treaties between the
                                    United States of America and the Several Indian Tribes, From

                                    Treaties between the United States and the Indian Tribes Now in
                                    Force as Laws</title> (1873) &#8212; and Kappler's
                                collation.<ref n="59" target="n59"/></p></item>

                            <p>Charles J. Kappler lived during a very critical period for federal
                                Indian law. He was born just months after the final recognized
                                treaty was signed with the Nez Perce,<ref n="60" target="n60"/> and his life spanned seventeen
                                Presidents &#8212; from Andrew Johnson to Harry S. Truman
                                &#8212; each of whom struggled to some degree with American
                                Indian issues. The linkage among Kappler's desire, and the mandate
                                instilled by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, to collect the
                                scattered documents of the interactions between the Indian Nations
                                and the federal government; a major proportion of his own legal
                                career during the period of New Deal reforms; Felix S. Cohen's
                                vision of a sound and well understood federal Indian law; and
                                virtually all litigation<ref n="61" target="n61"/> involving the tribes since the creation of
                                the United States is premised upon the assurances contained in those
                                legal instruments. Without Kappler's ensemble of the final texts of
                                these critical documents and his efforts in their application, the
                                turmoil within this broad area of jurisprudence would have been far
                                worse over the last century.</p>

                    District of Columbia has birth certificates from August 1874 forward. Heckel
                    (1968, p. 315) stated the birth year was 1869, but when he specified that
                    "Kappler died on January 20, 1946, aged 77" (p. 316), this age was attainable
                    only if the birth year was 1868, i.e., 77 years could have expired only between
                    16 November <hi rend="italic">1868</hi> and 20 January 1946. Kappler's death
                    notice in <title>The Evening Star</title> indicated the same age (Charles
                    Kappler Dies; Expert and Writer on Indian Affairs, 1946). While the 1900 Census
                    records 1869 as the birth year as well (Department of the Interior, 1900), two
                    later references cited 1868 as the appropriate year. The entire family
                    &#8212; Charles, Katherine, Suzanne, and Charles Jr. &#8212; sailed from

                    onboard has 1868 as Kappler's birth year. Similarly, on a return trip of the

                    (Department of Labor, 1934). Ultimately, Kappler's death certificate stated
                    "Nov. 16, 1868" as the "Birth date of the deceased" (Certificate of Death,
                    1946).</note>
                <note id="n04">4 Heckel (1968) noted that Mark Twain served as a previous secretary
                    for the Senator in 1867, during the latter's first term in Washington following
                    his election in 1864. Elliott (1983, p. 65) stated "the relationship did not
                    last, and after a few months, Stewart asked Twain to leave." Hoffman (1997, p.
                    134) remarked that Twain "rapidly learned to imitate Stewart's signature well
                    enough to use the senator's franking privilege for his personal mail;" see

                <note id="n09">9 Hale's objections had less to do with fiscal matters and more to do
                    with speaking out against previous subject undertakings. He characterized prior
                    works as being "useless" and as merely providing opportunities for committee
                    clerks to earn extra money by thoughtlessly "dumping" material into
                    ill-conceived publications. However, he saw value in a well-prepared set of
                    these transactions, commenting: "I can understand that on this subject,
                    pertaining to all the treaties with the Indians and the action of the Department
                    upon them, a good, well-edited, well-indexed document might be very valuable,
                    and the index is the most valuable part of it all. Half of the works that have
                    been prepared heretofore. . . have no index at all, and of those that have
                    indexes they are very poor and afford no light to anyone; they do not cut short
                    the work which they were intended to do and they are useless. Any Senator who
                    looks at such a book once never looks at it again" (Compilation of Indian

                    comparable in Scott (1916, pp. xxxii&#8211;ci). The United States maintained
                    a reservation on the subject of Article 48 at the first Conference, and
                    reiterated this proviso at the second Conference. There was also another
                    condition, in the act of ratification of 27 November 1909, which pertained to
                    Article 53 (p. xlvii).</note>
                <note id="n12">12 This case has a robust history. Almost immediately after the 1697
                    decree by King Charles II of Spain authorizing the Jesuits to colonize
                    California, this religious order began a donation drive there to finance the
                    conversion of the local Indians. Johnson (1963, p. 16) observed that "[i]t was
                    estimated that the equivalent of 500 dollars per year was required for each
                    mission and a goal of $10,000 was set for each establishment on the basis of an
                    earning rate of five percent." After the Jesuits were removed in 1767, the fund
                    was administered by Spain, and then later by the new Mexican government.
                    Following the <title>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</title> in 1848 (<title>Treaty
                        of peace, friendship, limits, and settlement with the Republic of
                    Mexico</title>, 1848), the Archbishop of San Francisco and the Bishop of
                    Monterey demanded a portion of the income of that endowment. Mexico refused; the
                    United States and Mexican Claims Commission was created to address the issue
                        (<title>Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of
                        Mexico, for the adjustment of claims</title>, 1868); and this Commission
                    decided in favor of the Church. Mexico paid the settlement, but refused to
                    continue payment in subsequent years. In 1902, a process was created between the
                    two countries that brought the deadlocked case before the Permanent Court of
                    Arbitration in The Hague (<title>Protocol of an agreement between the United
                        States of America and the Republic of Mexico for the adjustment of certain
                        contentions arising under what is known as "The Pious Fund of the
                        Californias,"</title> 1902). The Court found for the Church again, with
                    1,420,682.67 Mexican pesos due for the long-accruing interest on the Fund and
                    with the additional assignment of a perpetual yearly assessment of 43,050.99
                    Mexican pesos. See the syllabus and the Award of the Tribunal in Scott (1916,
                    pp. 1&#8211;7). Kappler later remarked on the case in a Letter to the Editor
                    at The Washington Post (Precedent for U.S.-Mexico Arbitration, 1938). The
                    Mexican government made this annual payment only through 1914. A final lump sum
                    settlement, with an accrued value of 8,987,129.54 Mexican pesos (or $719,546, at
                    the conversion rate of 12.49 pesos to the dollar at that time), was derived in
                    1967 (United States and Mexico agree on settlement of Pious Fund claim, 1967;
                    Settlement of the Pious Fund claim, 1967). Weber (1963) supplies a full review
                    of the <title>Pious Fund</title> history, almost to the date of the final
                    settlement. Stewart, however, in the final chapter of his autobiography (1908,
                    pp. 356&#8211;357), wrote only three paragraphs on this case, less than he
                    did on his interactions with his short-lived earlier secretary, Mark Twain (pp.
                    219&#8211;224). Doyle (1906), the primary attorney for the Archbishop and
                    the Bishop, had another perspective. He presented a deposition at the trial
                    (Appendix II, 1903, pp. 399&#8211;405). Elliot (1983, p. 237, n.84) remarked
                    that Stewart, Kappler, and one other attorney that Stewart enlisted &#8212;
                    Jackson H. Ralston, an international law specialist and cousin of the Secretary
                    of State, John Hay &#8212; were each compensated $20,951.20 for their work
                    on the Pious Fund suit. Ralston, apparently, was well known to Stewart and to
                    Kappler &#8212; all three were involved in the Pillow-Inhaler Company that
                    Stewart formed in 1898 (A New Company, 1898), and he was the ultimate author of
                    the report that presented the final Pious Fund tribunal results (Appendix II,
                    1903; see p. 1). Elliot's compensation footnote for the three lawyers in turn
                    points to Gaffey (1976), who cited a 13 May 1904 document from the Archives of
                    the Archdiocese of San Francisco that is a "[r]eceipt for $62,853.62 in full
                    payment of all claims under contracts for counsel fees made December 24, 1899,
                    and November 15, 1897, and release in full of all demands to date, and transfer
                    of all future rights under contracts" (p. 241, n.81). The transaction itself
                    remarks that the sum was composed of two payments &#8212; $20,750.67
                    (corrected to $20,705.67 in the margin) on 11 February 1904, and the remainder
                    of $42,147.95 in May. Stewart, Kappler, Ralston, Frederick L. Siddons

                    &#8212; signed this notarized document. This firm was involved with, inta
                    alia, Samuel Gompers and the labor movement; see the letter of 11 March 1909
                    between Gompers and the firm (Kaufman, Albert, and Palladino, 1999, pp.

                    (1907) also proposed adjustments and improvements to the Permanent Court.</note>
                <note id="n13">13 The case began just three days (Pious Fund Arbitration, 1902)
                    after Stewart's wife was killed in an automobile accident in California

                <note id="n14">14 Kappler, at the onset of his career in 1899, had an office in the
                    Corcoran Building (<title>Martindale's American Law Directory</title>, 1899, p.
                    1064). This structure had been the site of the original meetings of the famous
                    Cosmos Club, founded in 1878 by Major John Wesley Powell, who had been on
                    Stewart's western venture in 1889. The Club moved to Lafayette Square in 1882,
                    but it served as the incubator for the creation, in 1888, of the National
                    Geographic Society; Powell was one of its thirty-three founding fathers. The
                    Society had its offices in the Corcoran Building, perhaps allowing Powell and
                    Kappler to meet on occasion. The building was also the site of the United States
                    Court of Claims, between 1899 and 1964 (Cowen, Nichols, and Bennett, 1978, p.
                    85). The <title>Law Directory</title> stated in 1901 and in 1902 (p. 1112 and
                    1157, respectively) that Kappler was at 902 F Street N.W., which also was the
                    address for the offices of the National Society of the Daughters of the American
                    Revolution (see Train For Sick Soldiers, 1898). The 1903 edition then signaled
                    (p. 1188) that his office was in the Bond Building at 14th and New York Avenue,
                    N.W., i.e., at 728 Bond Building, according to a 1913 Board of Commissioners of
                    the District of Columbia letter that appeared in the <title>Serial Set</title>
                    (Persons owning or renting houses or rooms in the so-called "inhabited alleys"
                    in the District of Columbia, 1913). During a restoration in the mid-1980s, the
                    building's appearance was described as "a rather hectic wedding cake of
                    classical revival motifs. But compared to its featureless postwar counterparts,
                    it is a treasure" (Forgey, 1987). The architect had been George S. Cooper (Scott
                    and Lee, 1993; Weeks, 1994). Senator Stewart was also at this address during the
                        <title>Pious Fund</title> days (Doyle, 1906, p. 43), and Ralston &amp;
                    Simmons maintained their offices there, as well. In 1906, <title>Hubbell's Legal
                        Directory for Lawyers and Business Men</title> (1906, p. 39) presented the
                    business card for the new firm of Kappler &amp; Merillat, in the same
                    building. Besides general law, the card declared their areas of interest as "the
                    Court of Claims, U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and Departments." Land patent law
                    was added to their list (see <title>Hubbell's</title>, 1909, p. 41) to handle
                    tribal land issues like those concerning a 320 acre allotment in <title>Garfield
                        v. United States ex rel. Goldsby</title> (1907 and 1908) and a 40 acre one
                    in <title>Ballinger v. United States ex rel. Frost</title> (1910). See the
                    "Schedule of lands to be patented to individuals under the fourth article of the
                    above agreement" attached to the <title>

                    allotments to individuals, to the State of Wisconsin for "school purposes," and
                    to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a leading
                    missionary society (Andrew, 1992). See also Supreme Court of the United States
                    (1913, p. 17) for a comparison of the mandamus proceedings in these two cases
                    against two Secretaries of the Interior. Many such transactions are noted in
                    Kappler's third volume, as are the texts of laws pertaining to the issuance of
                    patents (Kappler, 1913). Section 5 of the <title>General Allotment Act of
                    1887</title> stated that "upon the approval of the allotments provided for in
                    this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause <hi rend="italic"
                        >patents</hi> to issue therefor[e] in the name of the allottees. . .."
                        (<title>An act to provide for the allotment of lands in severalty to Indians

                    purposes</title>, 1887, p. 389; emphasis added). There was a brisk business in
                    the handling of such patents until 1934, when the allotment program ceased; see
                    §1 of the <title>Wheeler-Howard</title> or <title>Indian Reorganization
                    Act</title> (<title>An act to conserve and develop Indian lands and resources;

                        to Indians; to provide for vocational education for Indians; and for other
                        purposes</title>, 1934). Kappler later took an office in the Transportation
                    Building, at 17th and H Streets, N.W. &#8212; the 1919 <title>Martindale's
                        American Law Directory</title> shows that he had made this relocation
                    &#8212; and that Merillat had gone to the Maryland Building at 1410 H.
                    Street, N.W. (pp. 1191&#8211;1192). The latter's address was confirmed in a
                    1927 appearance before the United States Board of Tax Appeals: the opinion for
                        <title>Merillat v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</title> (1927, p. 813)
                    states "[t]he petitioner is a resident of the District of Columbia, with offices
                    in the Maryland Building, Washington, D.C."</note>
                <note id="n15">15 Merillat was born in 1863 or 1864; the 1880 Census indicated that
                    he was 14 years old at the time, the son of John and Fanny Merillat, and the
                    oldest of six children (Department of the Interior, 1880b). See the announcement
                    of Merillat's graduation from the National University Law School, capped by the
                    presence of President McKinley at this event (From the President, 1897).
                    Merillat had asked the President to "officiate" at this reception (McKinley May
                    Distribute the Diplomas, 1897). In comparison to Kappler's frequent presence
                    over the years in both the social and the legal pages of <title>The Washington
                        Post</title>, Merillat's appearance in that newspaper was usually only found
                    in "The Legal Record" lists that enumerated the proceedings in the District's
                    courts, or in brief items on cases in which he served as counsel.</note>
                <note id="n16">16 The two appeared together, for example, before the Senate
                    Committee on Indian Affairs regarding the enrollment within the Osage Tribe
                    (Hearings before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on matters relating to
                    the Osage Tribe of Indians, 1909). They were also involved in a 1912 case before
                    the Court of Claims on the subject of a longevity pay allegedly due Charles J.
                    Allen of the United States Army. The court, however, concluded that "the claim
                    herein, not having been filed for prosecution before any court within six years
                    from the time it accrued, is barred" (Charles J. Allen: Letter from the
                    Assistant Clerk of the Court of Claims transmitting a copy of the findings of
                    the Court in the case of Charles J. Allen, United States Army, retired, against

                    that he remained in the Bond Building and carried on a practice with "special
                    attention to Indian Matters." This parting of ways was not absolute. A decade
                    later, the Amended Petition (1924, p.34; emphasis added) for the <title>Fort

                    at George Washington University in 1951, and was married in the same year (Miss
                    Julia Claud Becomes Bride of Mr. Kappler, 1951). His application for admission
                    to practice before the United States Supreme Court, filed in June 1956,
                    indicated that his original name was Charles J. Kappler, Jr. and that he was an

                    admission to practice, 1956). A later newspaper notice said that he left

                    (Who's News, 1962). He had served in the Army during World War II, after
                    enlisting on 10 August 1942 at Fort Myer, Virginia (Charles T. Kappler, 1942).
                    His obituary (Charles T. Kappler, 1993) stated that he had two sons and two

                    Kappler was given the Crow name Ish-Tua-Botsa-Che, or Chief Star, according to
                    <title>The Evening Star</title> (Charles Kappler Dies; Expert and Writer on
                    Indian Affairs, 1946). This English translation is apparently incorrect
                    (personal communication, Faith G. Bad Bear-Bartlett, 5 December 2006). Hoxie (1995, pp. 255&#8211;262) spoke of the Crow cases brought by Kappler and Merillat. Long after Kappler's death, <title>Crow Tribe of Indians v. United States</title> (1960) &#8212; before the Court of Claims and on appeal from the two Indian Claims Commission outcomes, <title>The Crow Tribe of Indians v. United States</title> (1954 and 1958) &#8212; resolved at last the question initiated in the late 1920s by the earlier Court of Claims case, <title>Crow Nation v. the United States</title> (1935).  The Court noted that the Indian Claims Commission had determined in 1958 that "the lands had a market value in May of 1868 (i.e., at the time of the <title><ref n="http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cro1008.htm">Treaty with the Crows, 1868</ref></title>) of an average of $0.40 per acre, but that the Tribe had received less than $0.054 per acre" and that this federal consideration was "unconscionable" (<title>Crow Tribe of Indians v. United States</title>, 1960, p. 284).  After taking into account previous token payments and the ever-present government offsets, the tribe was awarded the sum of $10,242,984.70 for their 30,530,764.8 acres (p. 301).</note>

                    part, to "acquire, take, hold, in fee simple, by gift or grant, all that portion

                    Beall (Conroy, 1980). As an interesting architectural note, the small Chapel was

                    upon "administration, conservation, and management of large areas of public
                    lands." The Office was a major contributor to the funds used to publish Felix

                    these instances were, under the first two treaties, the St. Louis and Nebraska
                    Trunk Railroad for tribal land purchases within Nebraska and the Atchison and

                    half later (Kappler, 1904a, pp. 865&#8211;866).</note>
                <note id="n54">54 The opinion concluded: "The total of the specific offsets found
                    herein to be proper offsets under the terms of the jurisdictional act exceed the
                    amount which the court has found to be due plaintiff bands by defendant.
                    Plaintiffs are, therefore, not entitled to a judgment against the defendant and
                    the petition is dismissed" (p. 455).</note>
                <note id="n55">55 In its response, the federal government's Brief for the United
                    States (1944) was 31 pages long, citing just seven treaties. It is interesting
                    to note that the Brief for Petitioners referred to a publication of the Home
                    Missions Council of North America (1944, p. 33) and to Cohen's
                    <title>Handbook</title> (1942) in the process of stating that "[i]t has been
                    calculated that 389 treaties were entered into with the Indian Tribes of the
                    United States" (1944, p. 28; emphasis added). This is well after Kappler had
                    published volume 2 of <title>Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties in 1904</title>,
                    with its total of 388 documents. That 1904 value, however, included seven
                    supplementals and fifteen unratified instruments, but did not involve the first
                    seven recognized documents created by the British, nor the two United States
                    transactions that only appeared in <title>American State Papers: Indian
                    Affairs</title> (see Bernholz, Pytlik Zillig, Weakly, and Bajaber, 2006). The
                    recognized number today is 375; if the Brief had used Kappler's published list,
                    it would have declared only 366 treaties.</note>

                        <title>Handbook of Federal Indian Law</title> in Martin (1995). Note too
                    that the outcomes of six cases in Table I &#8212; including the
